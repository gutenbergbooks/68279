<h3 class='c006'>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Blue Gulch was relaxing after the ardors of
its working-day. From the direction of the
Cheerful Heart Dance Hall issued sounds of mirth
and festivity, and a weaving fantasy of shadows
on its canvas walls proclaimed to those without that
the cheerful hearts were in executive session.</p>

<p class='c008'>A man coming furtively along Upper Broadway
made a detour to avoid the bar of light that shone
through the open door of the hall. He passed behind
the building, and around the big fandango,
where the trip of feet mingled with the tinkle of
a guitar and the whirr and thump of a wheel of
fortune.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It can’t be anywhere along here,” he muttered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>coming back to the road and pausing to survey the
starlit scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blue Gulch had but one street, the two sides of
which lay at different levels, separated by the wide
yawn of the gulch itself, thrusting into the mountain
from the desert below. From where the man
stood he commanded a very complete view of the
place. In nearly every house was a light, and the
shadows thrown upon the canvas walls gave a fair
clue to the occupations of those within; so that
during the early part of each evening at least
neither half of the town need be in any doubt as
to how the other half was living.</p>

<p class='c008'>The life and gaiety of the community in relaxation
seemed to gather upon the upper plane.
Across the gulch Lower Broadway lay in comparative
darkness.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man drew back again as a couple of
shadowy forms came wavering down the road.
One of these carried a lantern, which hung low at
his side, revealing the heavy miners’ boots of the
pair, and casting grotesque shadows up the mountain-side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where’s Westcott? Why ain’t he along?”
one asked, as they passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The skulking figure in the shadow strained his
ears to listen, one hand pressed upon his mouth to
keep back the cough that would have betrayed him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>“He’s back at his office, digging,” was the careless
response. “Westcott ain’t a very cheerful
cuss.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The two laughed lightly, and disappeared within
the dance-hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they were out of sight the man came
forth again, hurrying past the glowing windows
of the Red Light Saloon, stopping beyond it to
muffle with his shapeless hat the cough that took
toll of his strength. He leaned panting against a
boulder, waiting to regain his breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>The way was more dimly lighted now. He was
nearing the civic center of the place, the one bit of
level ground in the gulch. Here, a faint light
showing from one window, was the mining company’s
hospital. Beyond this the man passed a big,
barn-like structure of wood, that announced itself,
by a huge, white-lettered sign, showing faintly in
the starlight, as an eating-house. Next it was the
low adobe hotel of the place, and farther on, beyond
a dark gap, was a small building, boasting a
door and two windows in its narrow front.</p>

<p class='c008'>The visitor regarded this place consideringly.
He thought it more than likely that it was what
he sought. Light streamed from both windows
and, stepping close, the prowler looked within.</p>

<p class='c008'>What he saw was a man writing at a rough pine
desk. The room was not large. One or two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>chairs, a couch, and some rude shelves, where a
few law books leaned; a small earthen-ware stove,
now glowing with heat, completed its furnishings.
The watcher’s eyes yearned to that stove. He was
shivering in the chill autumn night, and he wore
no coat. With a muttered curse he opened the
door and stepped quickly into the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man inside looked up from his writing,
peering past the lamp the better to see his visitor.
For a moment he stared, incredulous, then, as recognition
was confirmed, he softly slid a hand
toward one drawer of his desk. The new-comer
noted the movement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can stow that,” he snarled, scornfully, “I
haven’t got any gun.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other’s fingers had already closed upon the
handle of a revolver that lay in the drawer. With
the weapon in his hand he crossed quickly, from
one window to the other, and carefully pulled down
the shades. The intruder had stepped into the full
glare of the lamp, and now bent forward, his hands
upon the desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he stood thus, gaunt, haggard, panting, he
seemed little calculated to awaken fear. The
hands that clutched the table’s edge were trembling
and emaciated, and of a curious, waxy pallor.
This same pallor was in his drawn, sunken face,
and from out the death-like mask of its whiteness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>the man’s deep-set eyes gazed, heavy with despair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I haven’t got any gun, Westcott,” he repeated.
“You needn’t be afraid. You played a damned,
dirty trick on me, three years ago, but that’s all
done with. I ain’t here to throw it up against you;
but I want you to do me a favor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The lawyer had turned the key in the lock and
stood near the door, watching him intently, noting
the close-cropped head, the thin, pallid face, the
nondescript garments of the wayfarer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You managed to escape,” he finally said, slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I did.” The man coughed, clutching the
table for support.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I got away last week,” he explained, panting.
“Yes—and I stole the clothes,” with a glance at
the sleeves of his rough gray shirt. “I’m a thief,
now, just like you, Westcott.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other made an inarticulate sound in his
throat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll let all that pass,” the intruder said, with
a toss of one gaunt hand. “I’m up to no harm,
but I’ve got to have help. I’ve got out of that
hell you left me in at Phoenix; but it won’t do me
any good. I’m dying!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Another fit of coughing shook him, until he
reeled. Westcott pushed a chair toward him and
he sank into it, still gripping the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m dying,” he said again, when the cough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>had spent itself, “and I want to get back and die in
God’s country.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott sat down opposite him, still watching
him, intently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t walk back,” the man went on, “and I
ain’t fit to beat it back. You’re welcome to the
fifteen hundred you got off me; but can’t you—for
the love of God, <em>won’t</em> you—give me the price
of a ticket back to Iowa?”</p>

<p class='c008'>His dull, sunken eyes were akindle, and he
leaned forward, an agony of eagerness in his eyes.
The prison-born look of age fell from him for the
moment and it became apparent that he was not
only a young man, but must once have been a
comely one, with a powerful frame.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I heard you were attorney for the Company
here,” he went on, as Westcott still kept silent.
“You ought to be able to do that for me. You had
fifteen hundred of mine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The attorney flinched, ever so slightly, then he
rose, dropping the revolver into his coat-pocket,
and took a turn about the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I wasn’t such a beast as it looks,” he finally
said, speaking with difficulty. “I’ve been
ashamed of myself: I meant to stay and try to
clear you. I don’t know how I came to do it; but
Jim Texas swore’t was you; and I lost the money
playing faro at Randy Melone’s.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>The brief glow in the sunken eyes had burned
itself out. The man surveyed Westcott, apparently
without interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jim Texas lied,” he said, apathetically, “and
now <em>you’re</em> lying. You paid some of that money
to Raoul Marty for a horse; and you got away
with most of the rest of it in your clothes. You
can hear things, even in jail.” This was said with
a weary laugh, in which was no mirth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t always hear ’em straight,” the attorney
replied, with studied gentleness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I <em>was</em> ashamed, Barker,” he went on, quickly.
“I’ve been sorry ever since.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you’ll give me the price of a ticket?”
Hope gleamed again, in the dull eyes. Westcott
considered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I haven’t got the money here,” he mused;
“but I think I can raise some by to-morrow. How
would you get down to the railroad?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll take care o’ that—” another siege of that
racking cough. Barker leaned back in his chair,
faint and gasping. Westcott drew a flask and
poured some of its contents into a tin cup. The
other drained it, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’ll help,” he murmured, handing back the
cup. “I ain’t always so weak as this; but I’ve
been hitting the trail for a week, without much
grub.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“Did anyone see you come in?” Westcott asked,
with apparent irrelevance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. I kept out of sight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good!” The other nodded. “That’s what
you’ll have to keep doing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve got to go out and see what I can do about
that money,” he continued; “and you’ve got to
have something to eat. I guess I’ll have to lock
you in here while I’m gone, in case anyone
should come along. You needn’t be afraid but
that I’ll come back,” he added, as the other looked
up, in quick suspicion. “It’s safer so, and I want
you to have something to eat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I sure need it,” was the reply. “Mighty bad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know you do; I’ll bring it soon’s I can.”
Westcott moved toward the door. “You lay low
till I get back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re not going back on me?” Barker still
studied him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Going back on you?” Westcott laughed,
shortly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord!” he exclaimed, “Do you think I didn’t
have enough of that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He threw some lumps of coal into the little
stove. “I’ll have to douse the glim,” he explained,
“since I’ll be out around town, and someone
might wonder who’s here. You can lie down
there.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>He waved a hand toward the couch and Barker
nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m pegged out,” he said, wearily. “I’ll just
sit here by the fire. Lord! How long is it since
I’ve been warm?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He drew his chair nearer and bent to the glow.
Westcott lowered the light and blew out the flame.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll lock the door on the outside,” he said,
“And don’t you worry, Barker: I’ll take care of
you. Just trust me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess I’ve got to trust you,” was the helpless
reply, “I can’t do anything else.” And Westcott
stepped out into the night, locking the door behind
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once outside he walked along the plaza to the
head of the gulch and stood looking down upon
the town. The varied sounds of a mining settlement
at night came plainly to his ears. A new
dancer from over the border was making her first
appearance at Garvanza’s that evening, and the
Mexicans were gathered in force. There was a
crowd of miners in the Red Light Saloon. He
could hear their voices.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How I hate it all,” he muttered. “I wish I was
out of it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The post-office was on Lower Broadway in the
Company’s store, where a single light burned,
dimly. Farther down was the school-house, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>the school-teacher labored by day, with the half-dozen
white children of the town, and twice as
many young Papegoes. Behind the gulch, climbing
heavenward, verdureless, copper-ribbed, austere,
lay the mountain, where the mines were.</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott had been in Blue Gulch for more than
a year. He had drifted out of Phoenix after the
Barker affair, glad to get away, where he was sure
no one knew of the matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>There had been no question about Barker’s guilt.
Jim Texas swore to having seen him knife Lundy.
He couldn’t have saved him if he had stayed,
Westcott told himself. He had never understood
why they had not hung the fellow, instead of sentencing
him for life.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better have done it outright than to kill him
by inches in their hell of a jail,” he thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>But now what was to be done with the man?
Westcott stood scowling at a house down the gulch.
There was a light inside that threw upon the canvas
side-wall the gigantic figure of a woman,
coughing. It reminded him unpleasantly of Barker.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Damn the fellow,” he muttered. “Wha’d he
come up here for, anyway? He’ll never live to
get back east.” He walked on, turning up the
collar of his coat. “It’s coming winter. The
cold’ll kill him.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Again he stood pondering, while one by one the
lights down the gulch went out. Then he bethought
himself of his errand and went stumbling
down Lower Broadway in the dark.</p>

<p class='c008'>The storekeeper was just closing up, but the
young fellow turned back to wait upon him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t keep you more’n a minute, Farthing,”
he said, and proceeded to buy bread and cheese, a
tin of meat and a couple of bottles of beer. A
little package of tea was an after-thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Going prospecting, Mr. Westcott?” the clerk
asked, as he made up the packages.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott was at the door as he spoke. Young
Farthing was putting out the light.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Johnnie,” the attorney said, with the air
of just remembering, “I want to telephone&#160;...
‘long distance.’ I’m afraid it’ll take some time.”
He half hesitated.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boy looked disappointed; he had planned
to get over to the fandango in time to see the new
dancer. He spoke cheerfully however.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all right, Mr. Westcott,” he said, and
turned up the lamp again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why can’t I lock up, Johnnie?” Westcott
asked; “I’ll bring the key up to the hotel when I
come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you wouldn’t mind—” Farthing looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>relieved, “Everything’s all right but just turning
out the light,” he added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right.” Westcott gave him a little push;
“You go on,” he said, cordially; “I can lock the
door as hard as you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess that’s true, Mr. Westcott,” the boy
laughed, and with a relieved “good-night,” he departed,
as Westcott was turning toward the telephone-booth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Half an hour later the attorney was in his own
office, boiling water in a tin pail, on top of the
little stove, while Barker, warmed and cheered,
made great inroads upon the bread and cheese and
the tinned meat. Presently Westcott made tea in
the pail.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Seems like old prospecting days, don’t it?” he
said with ostentatious cheerfulness, as he filled the
tin cup. “I dare say you’ve had your share of
them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some.... A-a-h!” Barker drank, blissfully,
of the strong, scalding brew.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I located a good claim once,” he said, setting
down the cup. “But it was jumped. All I ever
got was—”</p>

<p class='c008'>He paused, in some embarrassment, and changed
the subject. “Great stuff, that tea,” he said, and
Westcott refilled the tin cup.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve done better for you than I hoped to,” he
volunteered presently. “I couldn’t raise the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>money in the town—too near pay-day; but I got a
pal of mine on the ’phone. He can let me have the
cash, and I’ll get it to-morrow. Don’t you worry,
Barker.” He answered the question, in the other’s
eyes, “I’m looking out for you all right. You
don’t need to worry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m a pretty sick man,” Barker answered, his
white face flushing. “I know I’m done for; but I
want to die in the open.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you talk about dying.” Westcott went
about the place making it secure for the night.
“You’ll be snug as can be here,” he added, “By
seven o’clock to-morrow morning this town’ll be
practically empty. All the men’ll be at the mine.
Sime’s going down to the plain to meet the stage,
and the school-teacher’ll be busy. We’ll get you
off in good shape.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He took some papers from the desk and put
them in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wouldn’t show myself, though,” he said.
“Keep the curtains down, and lay low. Lock the
door after me, and take out the key.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At the last words the man’s look of anxiety vanished.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” he replied. “I’ll sure lay low. I
haven’t slept much in a week. I’ll be glad enough
to take the chance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So long, then,” Westcott said, slipping out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So long,” and the key turned in the lock.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Having secured the door, Barker took the key
from the lock and hung his hat upon the knob.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t want anyone peeking in,” he murmured,
as he resumed his seat by the fire. He was no
longer cold, but there was companionship in its
glow.</p>

<p class='c008'>The meager little office was a palace compared
with the cell from which he had escaped, he
thought as he looked about him in the dim light
from the open door of the stove.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If he plays me any more tricks—” His mind
reverted to Westcott, and the cold sweat stood
upon his forehead at the idea of possible treachery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pshaw!” he muttered. “There’s nothing more
he can do. He’s done it all. God! To think I
swore to kill him at sight, and here I am begging
favors of him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The angry snarl in his voice changed to a cough,
and ended in a whimper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I couldn’t do anything else,” he pleaded, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>though arguing with someone. “I want to get
back east. I want to die in the open. Hell! I was
going mad in that hole.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He rested his head between his fists, torturing
himself with memories of the days before he
crossed the Divide, the youngest chain-man in the
surveyors’ gang of a projected new railroad. He
had come from Iowa, and boy-like he sang the
praises of his native state all across the alkali
plains, until, in derision, his fellows dubbed him
“the Iowa barker.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The name stuck. In Nevada he was plain
“Barker.” The others seemed to have forgotten
his real name, and as Barker, when he left the
outfit, he drifted down into Arizona. He blessed
the easy transition when the trouble came that fixed
the killing of big Dan Lundy on him. He had
kept his real name secret through all that came
after.</p>

<p class='c008'>What had it all been about? What was he doing
here to-night? Why hadn’t he killed Westcott,
instead of sitting here by his fire?</p>

<p class='c008'>He passed a wavering hand before his eyes. Oh,
yes. Now he remembered. Westcott was going
to send him east—to God’s country. Meanwhile,
he was dead for sleep. He caught himself, as he
lurched in his chair, and rising heavily, he threw
himself upon the couch.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>It was past noon when he woke. The sun lighted
the yellow curtains; the door stood open, and
Westcott bent over him, shaking him by the
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Barker! Barker!” the attorney called.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Barker! Wake up! Time to get out of this.
I’ve got a chance to send you down to the railroad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>By degrees he struggled to consciousness, and
sat up. Westcott had brought him a big cup of
steaming coffee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Drink this,” he said, not unkindly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My friend came up with the money,” he went
on, as Barker drank, sitting sidewise on the couch.
“He’s going to take you down in his buggy. He’ll
fix you up all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Barker was still dazed with sleep. His ears
rang, and the lawyer’s voice sounded strange and
far away. The coffee made him feel better. It
soothed the cough that had racked him the moment
he sat up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now eat some grub,” Westcott said.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had brought food from the hotel. Barker
was still too far off to wonder at this. He had no
desire for food, but he ate, obediently.</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott, meantime, had gone outside. In front
of the hotel stood a big, rangy bay horse, hitched
to a light road-wagon. Near the outfit lounged a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>tall, determined-looking man, who came forward
when he saw the attorney.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve got to be getting a move on soon,” he
said. “It’ll be late night, as ’tis, before we get
there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll be ready in the shake of a horn,” the
other replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, Frank,” he continued. “He don’t know
who you are. I’ve let on you’re a friend of mine,
going to take him down. Let him think that till
you get out of town.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Must be a dead easy one,” the man addressed as
Frank said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you see,” Westcott laughed, nervously,
“I doped him pretty well last night—the poor devil
coughed so,” he added, in explanation, and the
deputy sheriff gave a grunt that might mean anything.
It brought a flush of embarrassment to
Westcott’s face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on,” he said, shortly, turning toward his
office. The deputy climbed into his buggy and
drove after him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got to hurry, Barker,” Westcott called, opening
the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>He escorted his charge briskly outside.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is Mr. Arnold,” he mumbled, beside the
wagon. “A friend of mine that’ll see you fixed
all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>The man holding the reins scrutinized Barker
closely as the latter climbed up beside him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” he decided, finally, speaking to
Westcott, and handed the attorney a folded paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what you were after,” he said, briefly.
“So long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A word to the bay colt and they were swinging
down Upper Broadway at a pace that made Barker
catch his breath as he noted the narrow road, and
the steep cañon-side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’d sure be a long fall,” his companion said,
answering his look, “But we ain’t goin’ to take it.
You can bank on the colt. He’s sure-footed as a
deer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ain’t afraid,” Barker responded. The fresh,
sweet air was beginning to clear his brain and he
sat up straighter, a touch of color coming into his
death-like face. The other man avoided his glance,
giving all his attention to the colt, who was swiftly
putting distance between them and the town. The
exigencies of the steep, rough road made such
attention necessary and neither man spoke again
until they had traversed the narrow pass, and were
out of the gulch. A sudden turn of the way
brought them among the foothills, the broad, yellow
expanse of cactus-dotted plain before them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Doesn’t seem as far as it did when I footed it
in last night,” Barker said at last, with an attempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>to smile, and Arnold nodded. The bay colt was a
good traveler, and they were on the level now, following
the road that wound its spiritless, grey way
among the cacti. The colt took it in long, free
strides, that promised to get them somewhere by
daylight.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good horse you got there,” Barker said, with
a country-bred man’s interest in animals. “Mighty
good shoulders.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet!” was the deputy’s hearty response.
“Good for all day, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I raised him myself,” he went on, “and he’s
standard bred, too, Daystar, out’n an Alcantara
mare.” He spoke with proper pride, as the owner
of a good horse may.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They raise some fine stock back in Iowa,” Barker
remarked, and his companion’s fount of speech
seemed suddenly to run dry. Barker waited, expectant,
for some little time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are we going to hit the railroad?” He
asked, at last.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The railroad?” Arnold looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Westcott said you’d land me where I could
get the train east,” the other explained. “He said
you had the price of a ticket for me. It’s all on
the level, ain’t it?” he demanded, his voice going
higher.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh—Oh! yes, yes! It’s all fixed. Don’t you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>worry none.” The bronze of the deputy’s face
crimsoned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you worry none,” he repeated, with a
glance at the sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>An ominous cloud lowered, overhead. The sun
was hidden, and the air had grown chill. A fit of
coughing had followed Barker’s flash of excitement,
and he crouched in his seat, shivering
slightly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here,” Arnold exclaimed, “you ain’t
dressed warm enough. They’s some kind of
weather breeding.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He reached beneath the wagon-seat and pulled
forth his own coat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Put this on,” he directed. “I’ve got my
sweater on, and don’t need it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Barker pushed it back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m all right,” he said. “You’ll need that
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You do what I tell you,” the deputy insisted.
“Put it over your shoulders. The wind’s at your
back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He thrust the garment across his companion’s
wasted shoulders and Barker drew the sleeves
across his chest.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he did so his hand touched something hard,
under one lapel. He glanced down at it, and
started.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“What’s that?” he cried, turning the metal
badge up for closer inspection.</p>

<p class='c008'>A groan of horror escaped him as he recognized
the object.</p>

<p class='c008'>He sprang to his feet, his long, gaunt hands
reaching for the deputy’s throat. Arnold swept
him back with one motion of his powerful arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you do anything like that,” he said, with
rough kindness. “You’d be just a skeeter if I
took hold of you, and I don’t want to. Suffering
snakes!” he pleaded, “Don’t look like that! I’m
sorry, man; by Heaven, I’ve hated this job like
blue poison, ever since I laid eyes on you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The words died away in his throat before the
dumb misery in the other man’s face. The wasted
figure was slumped forward in an abandon of
despair. All the man’s pride and courage died in
the face of his fearful disappointment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, God! Oh, God!” he moaned. “And I
thought I was going to die in the open.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned to the deputy, a sudden hope lighting
his woe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me get out,” he begged. “Let me get out
right here. I can’t get anywheres: I’m bound to
die; but it’ll be out in the open. Please let me
out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t.” The words came through Arnold’s
set teeth.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“Why not? I never killed Dan Lundy. Before
God, I never laid a finger on him.” Barker spoke
fast and thick, in his eagerness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I went to his shack and found him there,
knifed to death. And Jim Texas swore he saw me
do it. Swore it, mind you; when Hart Dowling
and I both knew Texas had threatened Lundy
time and again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A fit of coughing interrupted him, but he went
on as soon as he could, his hoarse voice breaking
now and then.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And Westcott came sneaking ’round to see
what there was in it for him. He was just starting
in then, and I’d heard he was a smart fellow.
I told him of the fifteen hundred dollars dust I
had hid in my shack. He was to find Dowling.
Dowling ’d gone up into Wyoming. Westcott
was to get him down here as a witness. And the
damned coyote was to have my fifteen hundred.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again the racking cough, and his voice trailed
off in a choking struggle for breath. He was
shrieking when he continued.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And Westcott took the money! Took it out
of my shack, and never came near me again. Left
me to die. They’d ha’ hung me, sure, if some of
the jury hadn’t believed Jim Texas lied.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The deputy’s face was twisted with pity and
shame; the man was so horribly broken.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“They’s a flask in the pocket o’ that coat,” he
said. “Take a pull; it’ll brace you up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t want it,” Barker snarled. “It chokes
me more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He had drawn the coat about him, the sleeves
tied across his chest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And Westcott went back on me this time,
too.” He took up the pitiful tale again. “He
couldn’t be satisfied, the devil, with what he’d
done. He had to do it over. But what for?
What for? I say? I never did <em>him</em> dirt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The deputy gave a start of surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why Westcott got—” he began, then pity
kept him silent. If Barker had not guessed he
would not tell him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Westcott&#160;... hell!” He spat savagely out
upon the desert, shaking his head with pity, as he
glanced again at the huddled figure.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Westcott’s a damned side-winder,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were descending into an arroyo, once the
bed of a creek; dry, now, for more than a year.
The road crossed it, here.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re going to get our weather, quick,” the
deputy said, as he noticed that the bottom of the
arroyo held tiny pools of water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even as he spoke a little stream came trickling
down.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“It’s us for the level! Quick!” he shouted, urging
the bay.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an instant darkness was upon them. A sudden
flash of steely blue rent the sky; almost with it
a quick roll of thunder was all about them and a
bellowing rush of water came tearing along the
arroyo.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bay colt squealed with terror, plunging
sidewise, heedless of whip and voice. The deputy
tried to turn him back to where the bank sloped,
but already they were sweeping along with the
torrent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A cloudburst,” Arnold shrieked, and with the
words he was wrested from his seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>The shafts of the light vehicle snapped short at
the gear. The colt, plunging, open-mouthed, was
hurled forward in a fearful somersault, and went
under, just as the wagon and its remaining occupant
rolled over and over, as a boulder might roll,
in the churn of maddened water.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was far into the night when, amid a matted
drift, half-way up one bank of the arroyo, something
stirred, faintly. Caught in a web of debris,
and a tangle of mesquite roots that thrust far out
from the soil, a man strove feebly to disentangle
his head from a smother of something that enwrapped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>it. When at last he partly succeeded he
looked up at the calm stars, lamping the sky in
solemn splendor. Below him he could still hear
the rush of water, but above all was peaceful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Long he lay, more dead than alive, trying to remember
what had happened. By the bright starlight
he managed to make out that the body of the
light wagon had caught upon an out-thrust web of
mesquite roots. He was lying on his side in the
wagon box, one arm thrust, to the shoulder,
through something that he could not see. About
his neck and head was a tangle of cloth which he
made out to be the deputy’s coat, and a long thong
of leather, probably one of the harness reins.
This was wound, as well, about what remained of
one of the seat braces.</p>

<p class='c008'>Slowly, by agonizing degrees, the man began to
work himself loose from the tangle. Then he discovered
that the thing binding his shoulder was
the strap of a horse’s nose-bag, and the bag itself.
It was caught over a long, splintered fragment of
the reach, which had broken through the bottom
of the wagon box. The bag seemed to be about
half full of oats.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inch by inch he cleared himself, and laying hold
upon the mesquite roots, rose slowly, until he stood
up. Every movement was pain, but he persisted
doggedly, climbing little by little up the bank,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>clinging now to a root of mesquite, now to a point
of rock, pausing for breath, or to ease the strain
upon his tortured muscles. At last he grasped the
trunk of a mesquite and dragged himself out upon
the desert, where he fell helpless upon the sand.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The shadowy bulk of distant mountains
changed to pale blue as the purple of night
slowly lightened. The stars faded, one by one,
and a spectral moon slipped wearily down the sky.
Beyond the scant mesquite fringing the arroyo
the desert lay still and gray, like a leaden sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man woke, and moved slightly, groaning
as his wrenched and stiffened body protested.
Consciousness strengthened, and he struggled to
his knees to stare about him. The chill of early
morning had him by the bones, and he shook in
its grip. After a little he got to his feet and tried,
painfully, to swing his arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Away westward a subtle hint of color crept
across the pale sky, heralding a coming radiance in
the east; but it brought no sense of comfort.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s no one left alive but me,” the man
whispered, as his gaze took in the awful solitude.
“No one but me, Gabriel Gard!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The sound of that name, spoken all unconsciously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>made him start, and look furtively about.
The loneliness of the plain had betrayed his jealously
guarded secret. Then his mood changed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve a right to die with it, at least,” he muttered.
“They can’t steal that from me. Barker’s
dead, already. Gabriel Gard goes next. Hear that,
Gabriel? You go next. Y-a-a-h.... God!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A sudden agony of pain shook him as he began
to cough. Every muscle in his body was sore.
Then, as the racking grew less, he stood transfixed,
staring across the desert.</p>

<p class='c008'>A crimson glow from the coming sunrise flushed
far across the eastern sky, and coming toward
him, touched by its glory, was a figure that his
astonished brain sought to define.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was no mirage. He knew the marks of that
supreme cheat of the desert. This was no trick of
refraction or of reflection. He saw, as a man
sees, this creature silently, steadily drawing near.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a strangely familiar shape; vague, uncouth,
incredible, it seemed; yet he recognized it. He recognized
the slender, shuffling legs, the swinging
gait, the mis-shapen body, the ungainly, crooked
neck and high held head; but why, in the name of
reason, should a camel be coming to him, out of
nowhere?</p>

<p class='c008'>Nearer and nearer the creature drew, the uncouth
form now a wonder of azure and crimson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>as the light became stronger, and still the man
gazed, his bewildered mind refusing to accept the
testimony of his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was filled with awe. It was true, then, what
old prospectors had lately declared, that this solitary
wanderer was still in the desert, sole survivor
of the old Jeff Davis caravan.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Old man Dickson,
and again young Bennett, swore they had seen it.
Dickson told, indeed, of having had the creature
about his camp for nearly a week.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. When Jefferson Davis was Secretary of War he imported a
caravan of camels into the desert, to carry supplies for the army.
The creatures stampeded the army mules, whenever they appeared,
and the soldiers took to shooting them, on the sly. In time so
many were killed that not enough remained to form a caravan, so
the survivors were turned loose in the desert. Here they were
hunted by tourists, who shot them for “sport,” until it was supposed
that all had perished. It is known now, however, that one,
at least, survives. This solitary one still wanders about the desert,
and the writer knows of more than one prospector who has encountered
it, very recently.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>On came the camel, looking neither to the right
nor the left, its shuffling stride getting it over the
ground with curious swiftness. When it was very
near it stopped, under the mesquites, and seemed
to wait for the man to approach. Recovered
somewhat from his amazement, Gabriel Gard drew
nearer and, reaching out a tentative hand, touched
the creature’s neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>The animal neither started nor flinched, but began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>cropping beans from the mesquite trees, quite
as if the man were not there. Gard, noting the
action, became aware that he was himself faint
with hunger.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the desert, where he had thrown it in rising,
lay the deputy’s coat, and tangled with it Gard
found his own canteen. He took this as a good
omen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I may need you, yet,” he whispered, as he took
it up.</p>

<p class='c008'>In one pocket of the coat was a nickle watch,
made fast by a leather thong, to a buttonhole.
Another contained the deputy’s pipe, some loose
tobacco, and a water-tight box, in which were
fourteen matches. Gard counted them, carefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned to the other side-pocket, with but
faint hope that the flask which he had scorned the
day before would be in it yet.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was there, however, and beside it, in a greasy,
crushed packet, a big beef sandwich. The deputy,
accustomed to provide against long rides in the
desert, had secured this before leaving the hotel.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man ate it eagerly, and took a swallow from
the flask. The food, and the fiery liquor, warmed
him, and revived his courage.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the coat’s inner pocket were papers, a worn
memorandum book, an envelop covered with
figures, another, longer one, containing a document.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>As Gard turned them over a postal-card
fell to the desert.</p>

<p class='c008'>He picked it up. On the back were a picture,
and some printing. The man read the latter
through before he realized what the card was for.
It published his escape from jail, and the fact that
five hundred dollars reward was offered for his
capture.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now he remembered the deputy’s unfinished
sentence, and knew why Westcott had betrayed
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott had got that reward! He had sold
him back to death as he had sold him before.
God! Why could he not have had his fingers upon
that lying throat just once? He would have found
strength for the job that needed doing!</p>

<p class='c008'>He stretched forth his wasted, jail-bleached
hands, and regarded them, snarling. Then he
raised them, shaking them at the sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll live to do it yet! Do you hear?” he
shrieked, “I say I <em>will</em> live!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He beat the desert air with his clenched fists.</p>

<p class='c008'>“God—devil—whatever you are that runs this
hellish world, you’ve got to let me live. I’ll
make that infernal side-winder wish he could hide
in hell’s mouth, before I die!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The torrent of his rage was stemmed by a
vicious attack of that racking cough. It tore his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>chest, and flecked his lips with blood. When it
was over he lay upon the sand for a long time,
sobbing the dry, anguished sobs of a man’s helpless
woe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun, rising above the distant mountains,
shone red upon him. The camel left the mesquite’s
thin shade for the warmer light and the
pad of its soft feet aroused Gard. He must not let
the creature get away.</p>

<p class='c008'>He rose, painfully, and went to it, considering
the brute carefully. A plan was dawning in his
brain. He took the strap that served him for a
belt, and buckled it around the camel’s neck. The
animal followed him, docile as a sheep, when he
led it back to the mesquite. Then he bethought
himself of the oats, in the horse’s bag, below.</p>

<p class='c008'>Going to the edge of the arroyo he could see it
in the wreck of the road-wagon, and he made his
way painfully down to it. As he was clambering
back he noticed that the back spring of the light
rig still clung to it by a single bolt. A slight
wrench brought it away, and he secured it, with a
vague feeling that it might prove useful.</p>

<p class='c008'>The full horror of his position was becoming
clear to him. He was alone in the desert, without
food or weapons. He put the thought away, summoning
all his faculties for the need of the moment.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>The camel was indifferent to the oats, turning
from them to the mesquite, after a tentative investigation.
With his belt and the harness rein, Gard
proceeded to fashion a sort of rude hackamore,
which he put over the creature’s head. The great
beast, as soon as it was adjusted, settled itself,
as by instinct, in an attitude of waiting, while
Gard proceeded to fill his canteen and to gather
quantities of mesquite beans, bestowing them
in the feed bag, and in the pockets of Arnold’s
coat.</p>

<p class='c008'>He threw the coat across the camel’s back, the
buggy-spring and the bag secured by its knotted
sleeves. Then he took the leading strap in his
hand, spoke to the animal, and they moved out
upon the desert.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard had no idea in which direction it was best
to go, but he argued that the camel knew the plain,
and its fastnesses. For himself, he had but one
thought—to hide, to rest, to gather strength for
vengeance. At that thought he stifled the cough
that rose in his throat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once they were started he let the strap hang
loose and gradually fell behind. The camel went
forward a few paces in the direction ahead of
them, but feeling no guidance, gradually deflected
its course toward the west. Gard followed every
movement eagerly, until presently they were going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>forward at a steady pace, as travelers with a definite
aim.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun was well up now, and its beams warmed
the man’s chilled, sore body. The desert was no
longer gray, but a glowing yellow. Even the air
was warm-hued, suffusing the landscape with a
roseate loveliness that yet seemed less of life than
of death.</p>

<p class='c008'>Everywhere were the desert growths, travesties
of vegetation, twisted, grotesque, ghostly gray and
pale green in hues. A profound stillness, insistent,
oppressive, was upon everything. The yellow
sand, the glowing air, the cloudless dome of the
sky, the far-off mountains, all seemed to soak up
sound. The world lay hushed in fierce, tense quiet,
as though waiting the appearance of some savage
portent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The camel did not hasten. Gard, walking beside
it, had a feeling that the creature was very
old. Its eyes were bright, its coat silky and fine,
but deep under the hair’s soft luxuriance the man’s
fingers felt the skin, wrinkled and folded over
shrunken muscles.</p>

<p class='c008'>But there was neither feebleness nor hesitation
in the forward progress of the desert pilot. It
moved forward with a sort of inexorableness, its
padded feet making no sound on the hard sand, its
gaze bent steadily ahead, its inscrutable visage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>wearing ever, a look of centuries-old scorn for all
things made.</p>

<p class='c008'>They passed a huge bull-snake sunning upon a
rock, and here and there a silent bird flitted to or
from its home in some thorn-guarded cholla. Once
a coyote tossed lightly across their vision, a blown
gray feather along the horizon, but no other signs
of animal life stirred the death-like plain.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sand grew warmer in the sun’s rays, till
permeating heat radiated from it and hung over it
everywhere, a palpable, shimmering mist of lavender
and gold, between earth and air. By mid-forenoon
the sun’s rays were oppressive, and they
halted in the shadow of a giant suhuaro.</p>

<p class='c008'>The camel, when the man released the leading-strap,
lowered itself slowly to rest, doubling down
its legs like the shutting of a jack-knife, and settling
upon the sand with the curious, sighing grunt
of old age.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard, in the meantime, set about the preparation
of a meal. He shelled a handful of tree beans and
crushed them between two stones, mixing them
with water from his canteen into a sort of paste,
which he ate. The suhuaro’s fruit was yet hanging
upon its great branches, dried, somewhat, by
the autumn sun and wind, but palatable and nutritious
still. Gard found a long pole, once part of
the frame of another giant cactus, and with this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>succeeded in knocking down some of the fig-like
growths.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he had eaten them he stretched himself
upon the sand, filled the deputy’s pipe, and lighted
it with one of the precious matches. The unwonted
luxury brought him comfort, and ease of
mind. He smoked slowly, making the most of it
in delicious relaxation, his head in the shade, his
weary, sick body basking in the heat of desert and
sunlight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lying thus there presently spread out before his
eyes the sudden vision of a great, island-dotted sea.
The surface of the water dimpled and sparkled in
the sun; the islands shone jewel-like with verdure,
an exquisite suggestion of rich color was over
it all.</p>

<p class='c008'>His eye was not deceived, though his mind half
accepted the vision. He knew that it was a mirage,
but he lay for a long time watching its changing
beauty, a half-amused sense of superiority to illusion
ministering pleasantly to his pride. The
scene was so very like what it seemed to be.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly, from the surface of the sea rose a
monstrous thing, huge, formidable, portentous, and
endowed with motion. Gard turned upon his side,
with a gasp. The mystic sea still wavered in the
distance, but the shape was no part of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>An instant he studied it, then sank back with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>sigh of relief. The apparition, upon scrutiny, had
resolved itself into a little wild burro, perhaps a
quarter of a mile away, passing across the face
of the mirage. It was such a germane little shape,
this familiar of the desert, that he was cheered by
the sight of it. The next instant he noted a
tarantula, hairy, vicious, glaring at him from a
tiny eminence of sand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Acting upon impulse, Gard hurled at it the
rounded stone with which he had crushed the
mesquite beans. The missile struck the sand close
beside the tarantula and the huge spider sprang
upon it in a frenzy of stupid ferocity. The man
laughed silently, a laugh not good to see.</p>

<p class='c008'>A shadow floated across the plain, and then another.
The man glanced upward, to see three or
four great black forms circling against the blue.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You would, eh?” he shrieked, springing to his
feet. “Yah! Not yet, you devils! I’m not dead
yet!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He shook his fist skyward at the huge, waiting
birds.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m alive yet!” he yelled. “You don’t get me
yet; not till I’ve had <em>my</em> meat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The cough seized him, and ere it let go its hold
the disappointed vultures, with never a stroke of
their wide wings, faded into the skyey depths.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Gard had no heart to linger further. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>sight of the desert scavengers had shaken him
sorely, he hastened to rouse his strange fellow,
and soon the pair were again threading that weary
way from nowhere to the unknown.</p>

<p class='c008'>All day they had moved steadily mountainward,
and now they began to draw nearer the range that
ever since dawn had reared a jagged line along the
horizon. Gard had not known whether they would
reach the mountains that day. One does not predicate
distances in the desert. They may be long,
or short; the lying air gives no clue.</p>

<p class='c008'>But as the afternoon shadows were turning to
mauve and blue, what had for hours looked like
sloping foothills, leading gently toward further
heights, suddenly reared itself before them in a
long stretch of high, perpendicular wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Straight toward it the camel went, never pausing
or looking around at the man beside him, and
when another forward step would have found their
progress barred, the creature swerved to the left, to
enter a narrow pass that appeared as if by magic
in the seemingly unbroken wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now the way wound upward along a dry wash,
climbing almost imperceptibly, at first, growing
steeper, by degrees, though at no time a sharp ascent.
The shadows closed in upon them, and the
air grew chill, but still the camel walked on, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>beside him, clinging, now, in his weakness, to the
animal’s long hair, toiled the man.</p>

<p class='c008'>More and more often he paused for breath, his
lungs tortured by the pace. He was faint with
fatigue, chilled by the shadow-cooled air, but a
drink from the flask gave him brief strength, and
he struggled on.</p>

<p class='c008'>An hour, and they were well within the mountains.
The way wound now among greasewood
and scrub oaks, with only here and there a cactus.
The chaparral drew dense, and Gard could hear
birds calling in its depths.</p>

<p class='c008'>The trail began to widen, and patches of coarse
grasses cropped out, here and there. The altitude
was not particularly great, but it was beginning to
tell upon the man when his strange guide halted in
a little open glade, where the wash ended abruptly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Night was falling, and Gard could make out
very little save that the forest growth closed in
the glade on all sides. Overhead he could just
get a glimpse of the purpling sky, where the stars
were already out. Off at one side he could see
these reflected in water, and he could hear, as well,
the gentle splash of a stream.</p>

<p class='c008'>The camel stood beside him, wearily patient
until, lifting a hand, he removed its load and
slipped the hackamore from its head. Freed, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>creature turned away, and presently Gard heard
him drinking, not far off.</p>

<p class='c008'>He followed the sound until he reached water,
and passing beyond the camel, knelt to drink his
fill from a clear, cold fountain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later he gathered such dry sticks as he could
find and kindled a fire, as much for protection as
for warmth. He was too weary to think of food,
but crouched before the cheering blaze, alternately
dozing, and rousing to feed the flame.</p>

<p class='c008'>As often as he did the latter he could see, in the
darkness beyond the blaze, the gleaming eyes of
small forest-prowlers, come to stare in wonder at
the strange thing by the pool. Nothing molested
him, however, and toward dawn he fell into a
profound, restful slumber.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The morning light did not confirm Gard’s impression
that he was in the deep woods. Beyond
the thin region of growth fed by the pool the
little valley into which he had been led lay sandy
and cactus-grown, like the desert. The stream that
should have watered it, that had probably, at some
time, made its way down the dry wash which he
had traversed, now found some underground outlet,
and was swallowed up by the vampire plain
below.</p>

<p class='c008'>Above the glade was a steep, rockbound ravine,
down which the stream still flowed. The pool
seemed to be its last stand against the desert.
Gard, tentatively exploring the lower end of this
ravine for fuel, found a few blackberries, drying
upon the bushes, and ate them, eagerly, with appetite
still unsated by his breakfast of mesquite beans.
The mesquite grew here, too; with manzanita and
scrub oak, arrow-weed, and black willow.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man’s chief sensation was a vague surprise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>at finding himself still alive. He was too sick—too
weak—after his exertion and his rages of the
day before, to consider the problem of keeping
himself alive. He was chilled to the marrow, and
yearned like a fire-worshipper toward the warmth
of his camp-glow. He tended the fire carefully.
He dared not let it go out; for that meant the
sacrifice of another precious match.</p>

<p class='c008'>The elemental appetite awoke when, stooping
to drink from the pool, he saw fish darting about
in its clear depths. He worked with the cunning of
a pre-historic man until, by means of the feed bag,
which he emptied of its contents, he succeeded in
catching two of these.</p>

<p class='c008'>A long thorn of palo-verde served him for a
knife in dressing them, and he cooked them in the
earth, with hot stones, laying each fish between the
split halves of broad lobes of the prickly pear.
They were insipid, and full of bones, but they
served to satisfy his hunger.</p>

<p class='c008'>He decided to keep a record of the days that
he should spend in this place; by sticking palo-verde
thorns into an out-reaching branch of willow,
near the pool. He would stick in a thorn for
each day. He cursed the first one, as he thrust
it against the wood; because he felt powerless to
do anything else.</p>

<p class='c008'>Following, half sullenly, a mere human instinct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>to be busy about something, he set about making
a knife from the smallest plate of the buggy-spring.
He heated it in his fire till the paint came
off, broke it in two and spent the day working one
thin end down to a cutting edge, on a big, rough
boulder. By night he had six inches of blade with
one rounded, sharp end.</p>

<p class='c008'>He used this, next day, to cut ocotilla-stalks, to
make a bed, scraping away the thorns with sharp
stones. He worked all day; less because he wanted
a bed than because he dimly realized that sanity
lay in occupation. That night he set a snare, and
before morning managed to catch a cotton-tail
which he dressed and roasted for his breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was getting over the feeling of being hunted.
They would not search for him now, he reasoned;
they must feel satisfied that he had died in the
cloudburst. He bathed in the pool that day,
when the sun was high, and set about constructing
a fireplace against the big boulder. This would
make fire-keeping easier.</p>

<p class='c008'>The days slipped into weeks. Little by little the
man was adapting himself to his environment. He
learned to dry the mesquite beans and grind them
between stones into a coarse flour. This he made
into little cakes, which he baked upon a flat stone
before the fire. Later, he turned over a patch of
earth, watered it, and sowed it with the oats he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>had saved from the storm. Now, however, his
food was the mesquite, the prickly pear, the century
plant, and the fish and small game that he managed
to catch.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he grew stronger he fashioned himself a
bow of oak, shaping and smoothing it with his
rough knife, and stringing it with fibres from the
century plant. His shafts were those of the desert
Indians, the arrow weeds growing close at hand,
and he tipped them with the cruel, steel-hard dagger-points
of the yucca.</p>

<p class='c008'>With this primitive weapon he gradually grew
skilful; and at last he shot a buck, as the creature
came down to the pool one night, to drink. He
dried the meat, and used the skin, when he had
made it ready, as a covering for his bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Twice, during the winter, the camel came back
to the pool. The creature went as it came, silent,
inscrutable. Whither it went Gard did not know;
the pool was evidently one of its ports of call while
going to and fro on the mysterious business of
being a camel. It accepted the man as a matter of
course, and left him, when ready, with the indifference
of fate, though Gard could have begged
it on bended knees, to remain.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was horribly lonely, with nothing but his
hate, and a sick longing for vengeance upon life, to
bear him company. There were days when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>cursed the chance that had kept his worthless hulk
alive, while sending Arnold, in all his strength,
down to death. He had no doubt but that the
deputy had perished. Nothing could ever have
come, alive, through the rush of water into which
he had been flung.</p>

<p class='c008'>The weeks became months. His oats were coming
up, a little patch of cool green on the yellow
sand, and he had occupation to fend the field from
the small desert creatures that coveted it. He also
worked at times at making various utensils of the
red clay that he found in the valley, baking them
in a rude kiln of his own fashioning.</p>

<p class='c008'>He came by degrees to love this work, and took
great pleasure in it. He even tried to contrive a
potter’s wheel, but was balked by lack of material.
He had to content himself, therefore, with modeling
the clay into such shapes of use and beauty as
his untaught hands could achieve. In time he came
to ornament his work as well, graving designs on
the edges of his plates and bowls. The camel’s
counterfeit presentment figured on one or two of
the larger pieces, and upon the others, as the impulse
prompted, he put inscriptions, until the
homely articles of his daily use came to be a sort
of commentary, seen by no eyes save his own, of
his moods, and the longing for their expression.</p>

<p class='c008'>He wrote thus upon other things as well. Lacking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>paper or implements charcoal and sharpened
sticks became his tools; the rocks and trees; his
broad earthen hearth; the plastic clay; even the
yellow sand of the desert, his tablets, and little by
little all these became eloquent of his lonely
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c008'>He put them down upon whatever served, for
the mere comfort of seeing them; scraps of lessons
conned in the old brick school-house; sums; fragments
of the multiplication table; roughly drawn
maps and sketches of boyhood scenes; lines from
half-remembered poems and hymns; familiar Bible
verses that his mother had taught him. They came
back to him bit by bit, in his solitude. And one
and all his soul found them camps by the way on
its long journey up from despair.</p>

<p class='c008'>From one of his excursions into the valley he
brought home the empty shell of a desert turtle.
This he split, and fashioned the upper half into a
bowl to contain the palo-verde thorns of his record.
They were already crowding the willow branch,
and but for them he could scarcely have realized the
passage of days.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were a hundred and forty-seven thorns
on the day that he transferred them to the new
receptacle. Gard could not be sure that he had
one for each day in the desert, but he knew that
each one there actually represented a day.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“I’ve had every one of that lot,” he told himself,
talking aloud, as a solitary man gets to do.
“Had ’em in the open, in spite of the law
sharks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He still lived from day to day, however, despite
his vows, and his threats of vengeance. He had
known, when he sought Ashley Westcott, begging
the price of a ticket east, that he was a doomed
man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s all borrowed time,” he muttered, shaking
the turtle-shell.</p>

<p class='c008'>His face darkened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’T ain’t either,” he cried. “It’s time won back.
They stole it from me down there. They robbed
me of three years, the filthy thieves! What’s a
hundred and forty-seven days against that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He remembered an occasion when to get away
from the wood-pile that was his special charge, in
his boyhood, he had heaped a scant supply of split
wood over a pile of chunks yet untouched by the
axe, and exhibiting the result as his finished task
had escaped with his fellows upon some expedition
of pleasure. He had meant to return in time to
complete his work before the cheat should be discovered,
but he forgot it.</p>

<p class='c008'>His father had first thrashed him well for his
wickedness, then lectured him tenderly about it.
The wicked, he had told him, would not live out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>half their days. Gard’s laugh as he recalled the
words was more nearly a snarl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He was a good man all right,” he said, “but he
didn’t know it all; not by an eternal lot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He tormented himself with other boyish memories:
the broad grassy stretches of the prairie came
up before him; the woods that neighbored his
father’s farm; the pleasant fields, and occasional
low hills that had seemed to him so high, before
he had seen mountains; the swimming-pool where
he and the fellows played in summer; the skating-pond
where they raced and built forts and fought
mimic battles in winter; the red brick school-house
at “The Corners”; the white church at “The Centre,”
where he had gone to Sunday school; the little
shed chamber with its creaking stairs that his
mother had climbed, how many cold nights! to see
if he were warmly covered. She was gone from
earth now, but the old boyhood places were left,
and he yearned for them all, with yearning unspeakable.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought I was going to get back to it,” he
groaned, through his set teeth. “I trusted that
poison-snake to help me; God! If I could get
these hands on him, just once!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the quiet of his hundred and forty-seven
days, and the balm of the healing air, had wrought
within him more than he knew. His excursions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>afield grew longer, day by day, and in the gray
of one beautiful morning he started out to explore
the mountain.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had traversed the cañon before now, climbing
over rocks, and around mighty boulders
washed down by ancient avalanches, or torn from
above by titanic storms, until he came to where
the mountain stream took a leap of some seventy
feet, and the sheer face of the cliff barred his way.
This time, however, he followed the cañon’s edge,
to which the trees clung precariously, sycamores,
oaks, and, to his delight, some walnuts. He
marked the spot where they grew, as a place to
be visited in the nut season.</p>

<p class='c008'>The morning was far spent when he reached
this point, so he lingered to rest, to eat the jerked
venison and mesquite bread he had brought with
him. Then he resumed his climb until he was well
beyond the timber growths and had to fight his way
through chaparral.</p>

<p class='c008'>He crawled among this on hands and knees, now
and then, frightening birds, and other small game,
from their hiding-places, and at last came out upon
the rocky open, and the broad spaces where the
large creatures of the mountains make their homes.
He noted more than one faint trail leading over
the wastes, and now and again he caught sight of
deer in the distance.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Higher still he climbed, into the regions of white
sunlight, until the cold, pure air of the snowy
ranges blew through his hair, and he began to feel
the altitude. In spite of this he pressed on, and
at last reached a ridge where grew a few scattered
heralds of the great pine belt above him. Here,
quite unexpectedly, the vast waste of the desert
suddenly met his gaze, far, far below.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a strange, horrible unreality about it.
The far gray plain; the mountain’s bare, brown
bones; the wind-distorted trees; the solemn, snowy
sierras, even the blue arch of the sky, seemed but
components of some fearful nightmare.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not asleep,” he muttered; “and it’s no
dream; I’ve died, and gone to hell!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The bitterness of desolation was upon him. His
very soul lay bare in the bright, white sunlight of
the heights, and he cowered, like a child afraid of
the dark.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he stood thus, from out the silence a soft,
clear whistle rose upon the air. It was repeated,
then taken up, farther away. The man quivered
as though the sound had struck him. Then his
tense muscles relaxed; he saw the whistlers to be
a covey of quail, moving along the rocks a little
below him.</p>

<p class='c008'>They came nearer, walking in single file, full of
curiosity about him, alert, speculative, keeping up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>a murmur of little ornithological remarks among
themselves, the while. The gentle fearlessness of
the small, pretty creatures filled all that grim place
with an ineffable grace. A sob strained at the
man’s throat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just as if they were in a garden!” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Long he stood watching the birds, who presently,
as if satisfied that no harm dwelt in him,
scattered about the rocky waste in search of food.
One only remained on watch, guarding the flock
from a little eminence where he stood motionless
save for his pretty crest, which the wind blew from
side to side. Gard watched him, fairly hushing his
own breath lest he alarm the small sentinel, who in
turn regarded him, with bright, innocent eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To think of it,” the man murmured, “the little,
little things, so fearless, up here in this—this—secret—place—of—the—Most—High!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He stopped, in vague surprise at his own speech.
He had not meant to say that, but from some
neglected recess of his boyhood’s memory the
words had sprung, vital with meaning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish,” he finally began, after a long pause,
and ceased speaking as a wave of sickening despair
swept over his soul. The idleness of the phrase
mocked him; the folly of wishing anything, helpless
there in the bitterness of desolation, came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>home to him with cruel force. Then the ache of
his spirit’s yearning drew his clenched hands up
toward the blue vault.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish,” he breathed, his heart pounding, his
brain awhirl with a sudden vision of the infinite
wonder of things, “I wish that—if there is such a
thing as God in the world I might come to know
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Slowly his hands came down to his sides. The
sentinel of the rocks gave a soft little call of reassurance
to the flock, which had halted, observant
of the gesture, and the birds resumed their feeding.
Gard turned for another look at the snowy
ramparts on high; at the vast plain below. All
their horror was gone, for him, and he began the
descent of the mountain with the peaceful visage of
one who has been in a good place.</p>

<p class='c009'>Far into the night he awoke with the feeling of
something stirring near him. In the dim firelight
he could make out a shadowy figure on the hearth,
and he sprang up in haste. A second glance, however,
as he sat upon his ocotilla bed, showed him
that there was no harm in the visitor shivering
there by the coals.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a burro, and the listless pose, the drooping
ears and the trembling knees proclaimed a
sick burro. It was too miserable even to move,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>when Gard threw an armful of brush on the fire
and speedily had a blaze by which he could see the
intruder plainly. His first glance revealed a
jagged, dreadful sore on the shoulder next to the
light.</p>

<p class='c008'>Speaking very gently, he drew nearer to the
burro and though the little creature trembled violently,
it let him bend down and examine the
wound.</p>

<p class='c008'>A great spike of the long, tough crucifixion-thorn
had somehow become imbedded in the flesh,
and the whole surface of the shoulder was swollen
and inflamed. Gard made a little sound of pity in
his throat, and the burro, turning, tried to lick the
sore.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No use to do that yet, Jinny,” the man said.
“That thorn’s got to come out first.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The burro had probably never before been
touched by hands; but not for nothing was Jinny
wide between the ears. She scrutinized her
would-be helper closely, for a moment, through
her long lashes, and drooped her wise-looking little
gray head still lower. Gard threw another armful
of light stuff on the fire and when the blaze was
brightest attacked the thorn, using one of his
sharp arrows as a probe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once or twice the creature flinched. Once she
snapped her strong teeth at the hurting side; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Gard worked steadily and quickly, and presently
had the offender out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look a’ that, Jinny,” he cried, triumphantly.
It was a joy to hear himself speaking to something
alive.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look a’ that!” he repeated, “Ain’t you glad
you found the doctor in?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He dipped warm water from an earthen pot in
the ashes, and washed the wound carefully, talking
all the while to the still trembling patient, silently
regarding him. When the place was quite clean
he made a poultice of prickly pear and bound it
on with a strip of deer-skin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lucky I shot another buck, Jinny,” he said, “or
you wouldn’t have that nice bandage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The little burro expressed no thanks; only stared
solemnly at the fire. Gard strode out into the darkness
and pulled, recklessly, an armful of his precious,
growing oats. He threw the green stuff
down before her and she sniffed it curiously before
she began, ravenously, to eat it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hungry, weren’t you?” the man said, sympathetically.
“Been too sick to eat. Well, well,
make yourself at home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He threw a big stick upon the fire and went back
to his bed, leaving the burro chewing, meditatively,
before the blaze.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was just falling asleep when he felt something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>warm fumbling about him, and he awoke
with a start, and an exclamation that quickly turned
to something very like a laugh. The grateful little
burro was licking his hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Jinny!” he cried, sitting up. “Well, well,
Jinny! Well, I’ll be jiggered!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He slipped an arm over the rough little neck and
the two watched the fire till dawn.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER V</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The burro got well and throve. Gard devoted
the period of her convalescence to teaching
her the essential arts of the higher companionship.
Her first lesson in burden-bearing was to bring
ocotilla-stalks from the valley. With these she
saw the oat patch fenced in from her own depredations,
and lifted up her voice in remonstrance when
she found herself barred out of that delectable
ground. Gard explained the matter to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is a world, Jinny,” he said, “where we
have to wait till the things we want are ripe. I’m
waiting myself, Jinny, for my time to come. It
will, some day, ah—some day!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was thinking of Westcott, but the curses that
he was wont to call upon his enemy’s head died
upon his lips. It was not that his hatred had died,
but there seemed, somehow, to be other things
than hate, even in his tiny world.</p>

<p class='c008'>He hunted up a palo-verde thorn with which to
mark his day, Jinny keeping him company. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>still kept the record on the willow branch, removing
the thorns and putting them away whenever
he had ten. There were that number this morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spring was well advanced, now. The air was
soft, and sweet with the scent of manzanita in the
chaparral. For days past hundreds of wild bees
had been hovering about the pool, and the underbrush.
Gard had a line on them, and thought he
knew where the bee-tree was located. His oats
were nearly ready for harvest; a century plant in the
valley was sending up a long bloom-stalk, and the
sound of water leaping down the cañon mingled
with the voices of birds in the chaparral.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Gard put back his shell, with its contents
of thorns and turned toward the pool sudden
recognition came to him of a heretofore unsuspected
truth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By the great face of clay, Jinny,” he said, drawing
a long breath, “We’re not so bad off, after
all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again his eyes ranged the green circle of the
glade; at the farther side, where the growth was
sparse, he could see the valley with its yellow sands
and rose-tinted air. The bright red of blossoming
cacti made vivid patches here and there in the
waste; even the great barren felt the touch of
spring.</p>

<p class='c008'>“God may have forgot this country,” the man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>said, after a long silence, “But He sure made it, if
He made the rest. It’s got the same brand, when
you come to see it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess, Jinny,” he continued, still gazing afar,
“that the best of one thing’s about as good as the
best of another. What do you think about it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>As Jinny did not commit herself he sat down
upon a rock and reached out to scratch the shaggy
gray head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I’d got back to Iowa when I wanted to,”
he went on, “I’d most likely be dead by now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jinny’s head drooped till her nose rested upon
his knee, and she nodded off to sleep. Gard let
her stay and sat looking off across the valley, his
mind full of new emotion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A man might think,” he slowly mused, considering
the mystery of his coming to this place, “that
’twas what old Deacon Stebbins used to call a
‘leading’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned the thought over in his mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>His eyes rested upon one toil hardened hand as
it lay upon Jinny’s back. He held it up, surveying
it curiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rather different, from what it was,” he
thought, clenching it into a great fist. “Yah—”
with sudden anger, “It’ll be different for Ashley
Westcott if ever he comes to feel it.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>His mind dwelt upon that possibility.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If ever I do get hold of him,” he muttered, and
then paused, as half-forgotten memories of that
faithful teacher came flocking to the front.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The deacon ’d be down on that idea,” he reflected.
“Wonder how he’d work his pet hobby o’
forgiveness here. He couldn’t judge of everything,”
his thought still ran on. “The deacon he
never got so near Hell as Arizona. If he had he’d
have found it a place his God of Mercy hadn’t got
on His map.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He put Jinny aside and set to work fashioning
himself a new cup. He had broken his only one
the night before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess I was wrong about that last notion.”
His brain took up the question again as he shaped
the red clay. “I guess He must have this place on
the map. Looks like His mercy’d been trailing me
here, so to speak.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He paused to contemplate the proportions of
his new cup, staring, half startled, at its rounded
surface. Phrases from the old psalm that mothers
love to teach were beating upon his brain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Goodness and mercy,” he murmured, feeling
his stumbling way among the words, “goodness
and mercy shall follow me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The familiar glade grew new and strange to his
sight, as though he saw it for the first time.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“Why!” he cried, a sudden light dawning, “Is
<em>that</em> what it means?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Almost mechanically he went on patting and
pressing the clay.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess it does mean that,” whispered he at
last, pinching up a handle for his cup. “I didn’t
think I’d be alive till now when I came up here.
I’ve wanted to die, many a time; but I’m glad,
now, I didn’t. I may get out of here some day,
too. I may live to get Westcott yet!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Goodness and mercy shall follow me.’” Was
that so he could live to see his dream of vengeance
fulfilled?</p>

<p class='c008'>Ah! He could not give that up! It could never
mean that he must give that up! Else where were
the good of remaining alive?</p>

<p class='c008'>No; no; it did not mean that! Even the old
deacon wouldn’t have thought he must forgive
what he, Gabriel Gard, had borne.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Lord,” Gard said aloud, “It can’t mean
that! It ain’t in human nature that it should mean
that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The cup in his hand was crushed again to formless
clay. He tore and kneaded it viciously, great
drops of sweat beading his forehead.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s against human nature,” he groaned as he
sought to bring the plastic stuff again into shape.
“I can’t do it! But—” The words rose to an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>agonized wail as his spirit recognized the inexorableness
of this demand upon its powers—“I’ve
got to. I’ve got to!”</p>

<p class='c008'>His mind went back to the day upon the mountain-ridge,
when he had seen the quail, and he remembered
his wish, the wish that had been almost
a prayer; remembered it with a hushed feeling of
awe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I’d sensed it,” he said in a voice tense with
his soul’s pain, “If I’d sensed that this is what
comes of knowing there’s a God, I guess I
wouldn’t have dared wish that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hour after hour the battle was fought over the
wet, red clay, and the day was far spent before
the cup was ready for the kiln. When at last
Gard, weary, but at peace, brought it for the final
perfecting of the fire, he paused, ere he thrust it
in, to read once more the rude letters graven deep
in its fabric.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>THE CUP OF FORGIVENESS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll see how it comes out,” he muttered,
grimly, but already the hope grew in his heart that
the clay would stand the test.</p>

<p class='c009'>Throughout the spring Gard busied himself with
building a cabin. He needed a place in which to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>keep his stores from prowling creatures. A brown
bear had secured a good part of the last deer he
had shot—secured it while it was drying on
branches of the mesquite—and the birds and small
beasts of the chaparral took toll of all his scanty
supplies. Then, too, he took a man’s delight in
construction, and the building of the cabin had
come to be a labor of love, as well as of necessity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The walls of the structure were of desert stones
laid up in mud. For the roof he brought skeleton
stalks of suhuaro. Later he meant to plaster these
with adobe, into which he should work straw, and
the coarse gramma grass of the region.</p>

<p class='c008'>He worked upon the building at odd times, as
the summer went on, taking increasing joy in
bringing it to completeness. He mascerated
prickly-pear cactus in water and soaked the earthen
floor with the resulting liquor, pounding it down
afterwards until it was hard and smooth as cement.
He made his door of ocotilla-stalks laid side by
side and woven with willow-withes. In the same
way he contrived a shutter for the window, and he
constructed a second, smaller, fireplace, within the
cabin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When we have distinguished visitors, Jinny,” he
told the little burro, “We’ll kindle a fire for them
here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He still used the larger hearth outside. He had
learned, after many trials, to kindle a fire with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>aid of flint and steel, and was no longer dependent
upon matches.</p>

<p class='c008'>When his shelter was complete he contrived
furniture for it, for the sheer pleasure of construction.
Lacking boards, or the means to manufacture
them, he wove his table-top of arrow-weed
and tough grasses from the cañon. It was beginning
to be a source of delight to him to contrive
solutions for each new problem of his hard existence.</p>

<p class='c008'>One night, in the early autumn, Gard was wakened
by a fearful crash of thunder. He sprang
from his bed, to find Jinny already huddled against
him. All about them was the roar of the sudden
storm.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pool had overflowed, and swept across the
glade in a broad stream, pouring down the defile in
a whelming tide. The heavens seemed to have
opened, torrentially; Gard’s bed was beaten down,
and the fire was flooded. Gard himself was almost
thrown to earth by the thrashing rain ere he could
reach the cabin, into which he darted, Jinny close
at his heels.</p>

<p class='c008'>The shelter was built against huge boulders, out
of the track of the flood from the pool, but the mud
and thatch roof leaked like a sieve. It served, however,
to break the fierce violence of the storm, and
they huddled there miserably till the worst should
be over.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>The sounds without were like those of a battle:
the echoing rattle of thunder down the cañon; the
rending of rocks; the crash of falling trees; the
screaming of the wind—all mingled in a fierce,
wild tumult.</p>

<p class='c008'>A flash of lightning revealed a great scrub oak,
torn from its anchorage above, crashing down into
the glade. The next instant the whole place
seemed filled with some giant thing that raged and
snarled, hurling itself from side to side in mighty
struggle.</p>

<p class='c008'>It dashed against the fireplace, flinging the great
stones of it in every direction, and fell upon the
uprooted tree in a frenzy of titanic rage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Its horrible roaring shook the cabin, and Jinny,
pressing against Gard, was almost beside herself
with terror. Gard himself, peering through the
window of the hut, could make out nothing definite,
until another flash suddenly showed him a
huge grizzly, reared upon its hind legs, striking
madly at the empty air.</p>

<p class='c008'>The storm had moderated, now, and he could
hear, as he strained to listen, the fearful snarls of
the bear rising above the roar of the wind. The
threshing tumult of its plunging had ceased, however,
and even the snarling had grown weaker.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rain ceased, but the wind still swept the
glade, and the pool had become a lake. Gard was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>chilled to the bone, but dared not venture without.
He had not heard the grizzly for some time, but
Jinny still cowered against him, trembling.</p>

<p class='c008'>At dawn he looked from the window upon a
scene of devastation. The ground was strewn with
debris. Great boulders had been hurled down by
the torrent’s force, and beside one ragged block of
granite lay the grizzly, terrible, even in death.
One side of its savage head was crushed in, and a
shoulder shattered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jinny was still too terrified to venture outside
the hut, but Gard went out and set to work to restore
some semblance of order about the place.</p>

<p class='c008'>The roof of the shack was a wreck. Gard had
to clear away a part of it that had fallen, before
he could find his precious matches and get a fire.
There were nine of the matches left, and it took
two to start a blaze with the soaked wood. He
breakfasted upon dried venison, which he shared
with Jinny, grown catholic in her tastes, and then
set about skinning and dressing the bear.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stretched and scraped the great hide, and
pinned it out upon the earth, (it meant warmth
and comfort to him through the coming winter
nights,) and cut the meat into long strips, to dry.
It would be a welcome change, later, from venison
and rabbit.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was noon before his toil was completed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>the traces of it so far removed as to ease Jinny’s
perturbation. He was obliged to bathe in the enlarged
pool before she seemed comfortable when
near him.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he dressed, after his ablutions, his eye caught
a broken bit of rock lying at the water’s edge. He
picked it up, a curious tightening in his throat.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is something about the glitter of a
streak of yellow in a bit of rock that would set
the heart of the last man on the last unsubmerged
point of earth to beating fast. The piece of float
was freshly severed and the flecks of yellow showed
plainly in its split surface. Gard scrutinized the
mud round about, and beyond the pool found another
bit of float.</p>

<p class='c008'>Forgetful of all else, he sprang up the cañon.
It, too, was full of debris, witness to the mighty
power of the storm. He hardly knew the place as
he climbed along, making a new way for himself;
for the swollen stream roared wildly where but the
day before he had been able to walk.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cañon walls on either side were wrought
and twisted by the action of ancient heat, scarred
and eroded by the force of ancient waters, but
they revealed no fresh break, though he scanned
them eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He kept on, however; for a quarter of a mile
above the pool another bit of float pointed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>way. It was a savage climb, but mounting, circling
and crawling past heaped up boulders and masses
of earth, he presently found progress checked by
a landslip, beneath which the rushing water was
already cutting a channel.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here lay the vein, uncovered, the gleaming particles
in the cloven rock making the man’s breath
come thick as he studied them.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no doubt about it: he had discovered
pay rock of the richest sort. How rich it was he
had no means of determining, nor did he then
dream; but he knew that right in sight was more
gold than he should be able to get out with any
tool at his command, and hope was already high
within him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stooped and picked up small fragments of
broken rock that lay among the debris. How
heavy they were! What power they represented!
What dreams might come true, by the aid of their
yellow shine!</p>

<p class='c008'>Here was his ticket east. Here was a ticket to
the uttermost parts of the earth. With it he could
go away, stand rehabilitated among his fellows.
Golden vistas of power and pleasure spread out
before him as he stood gazing long at the cleft,
yellow-flecked rock before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whoever runs this outfit,” he whispered, “has
remembered it, after all.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>It was long before he could bring himself back
to reality. Only the gathering autumn gloom,
coming early, in the cañon’s depth, finally recalled
him. He began turning over in his mind the means
he must contrive with which to meet this emergency.
If only he had the tools!</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s up to me to make some,” he said
aloud, and at the words he suddenly turned and
looked back at the golden vein he was leaving.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re great!” he shouted; “You’re bully to
have; but you ain’t all there is to it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He spread out his hard hands. “These that can
make the things to get you out with are better yet,”
he said, speaking more slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>For he suddenly remembered the pit from which
he was digged, and the man’s heart yearned to his
fire beside the clean pool, and for the life there that
he had wrested from nothing.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VI</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Gard and Jinny were on an expedition after
salt. The instinct hidden in the gray little
hide was so much more useful in the case than the
thinking machinery beneath the man’s thatch of
hair, that she had long ago led him to a desert
supply of this commodity, which he had longed
for, without being able to supply his need.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was utilizing the trip in an effort to make
Jinny bridlewise, a proceeding which filled her
with great displeasure. She was a sturdy little
brute, of good size for a wild burro, and she bore
his weight without apparent effort; but she had a
fondness for choosing her own direction, and objected,
strongly, to the guiding rein. She protested,
now, raising her voice, after the manner of her
kind, when Gard, from her back, essayed to turn
her at his will.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jinny! Jinny!” he remonstrated; “Not for
the world would I call you anything but a lady;
but I can’t be so mistaken, Jinny! You’re not a
nightingale!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Jinny was persistent, however, in her determination
to travel eastward, and although her companion,
had he been allowed a preference, would
have elected to go toward the west, he had learned
enough about his small gray friend to be willing to
trust her judgment in the matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Though I must say, Jinny,” he remarked, reproachfully,
as he gave her her head, “that it’s
spoiling the making of a good saddle-burro.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was well toward the end of Gard’s second
year in the desert. In all this time he had but once
encountered his own kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>On that occasion, too, he had been after salt, and
he had met a desert Indian afar on the plain. They
had talked together, after a fashion, by the aid of
signs, and Gard had learned that the railroad lay
three days distant, toward the north-west. This
was a matter about which he had often speculated,
and he was glad of the information. Because of
it, he proffered the Indian the deputy’s pipe, which
he had with him, happening, on that day, to be
wearing Arnold’s coat. The brave took it, the
gift only serving to strengthen his already formed
opinion that the gaunt white man with the great
beard was loco.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a year since the discovery in the cañon.
Gard had worked the vein, in a primitive way,
making for the purpose a rough mattock, from his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>useful wagon-spring. It was by far the best tool
he had constructed, and he regarded it with even
more pride and pleasure than he took in the two
heavy little buckskin bags for which he had made
a hiding-place in the chimney of the rehabilitated
cabin.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had arrived in these days at a strange content.
He loved the vast reaches of his large place;
the problems of his elemental environment. The
luminous blue sky, the colorful air, the immensity
of the waste plain, gave him pleasure. Even the
weird desert growths no longer oppressed him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“After all, Jinny,” he said, as they threaded
their way gingerly past a great patch of cholla,
with its vicious, hooked spines, “there’s as much
life here as there is death. I never sensed it before;
but everything’s got a claw to hang onto life
with.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The thought of returning to civilization was put
away with ever increasing ease. He had not abandoned
the idea, but it came as a more and more
remote possibility. Even his dream of vengeance
had long been put aside. He had learned the
futility of hate in the nights when he watched the
great stars wheel by, marking the march of the
year.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s nothing in it,” he had finally said to
himself.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“It ain’t a man’s job to be staking out claims in
hell for another fellow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>If Jinny, who heard this, did not understand, she
at least offered no contradiction, being by that
much wiser than many of her kind on a higher
plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>The desert stretched away before Gard, vast,
silent, untamed, at this moment a thing of gold
and flame, touched, far in the distance, by great
cloud-shadows, that sent the man’s gaze from the
fierce plain to the wide blue overhead. But not a
cloud was in sight and he realized that, probably
for the hundredth time, he had been deceived by
patches of lava cropping up among the red and
yellow sands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Something that was not a cloud arrested his attention.
Far in the sky half a dozen great black
birds flew, now high, now lower, but circling always
above one spot. Gard watched them with
an understanding eye.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jinny,” he said, “There’s something dying,
over there. You and I’d better go see what it is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He had dismounted some time since, and was
walking beside the burro. Now he started forward
at a faster pace. It might be only a hurt
coyote that the hideous birds waited for, but it
<em>might</em> be a man! The thought quickened his steps
still more, till Jinny had to trot, to keep pace with
him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Once an aerial scavenger swooped lower than
any other had yet done, and at the sight the man
broke into a run. The birds still kept off, however.
Whatever it was, lying out there, somewhere, it
was yet alive.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were traveling along the edge of a deep
barranca that yawned in the desert, and presently
Gard caught sight of a dark object lying on the
sand, at the bottom of the fissure. It was a man.
The banks of the ditch sloped just there. Evidently
he had attempted to cross, and had been
caught in quicksand.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was lying on his back, his arms outstretched,
his feet wide apart, a curious rigidity about his
whole figure. Gard’s long stride left Jinny far behind
as he ran.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hold on!” he shouted. “Somebody’s coming!”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no response from the man. He lay
as one dead, save for the occasional lifting now
of one arm, now of the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Down the sloping bank Gard ran, to the very
edge of the shifting sand. Here he stopped, and
began cautiously to tread, his feet side by side,
stamping, stamping, moving forward half an inch
at a time, but never ceasing to tread. He was
harried by the need of haste, but he made sure of
his progress as he went, knowing that the sand
must be solidly packed, every inch of the way.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>From time to time he spoke to the man, and at
last got a mumbled word or two from the swollen
lips. The need of haste was increasing every
second, and Gard worked breathlessly, now, till at
last he could touch his fellow, lying there.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still marking time with his feet upon the sand,
he slipped from his own waist the riata he always
carried when he came down to the plain. He had
made it himself of finely braided hide, suppled and
wrought with faithful care, and he knew its
strength. Working fast, he raised the man’s
shoulders, ever so little, and slipped the rope
beneath his arms. He knotted it into a loop and
adjusted it over his own shoulders. Then, getting
a strong hold with his hands under the man’s arms,
he straightened up.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sand slipped, and ran, gurgling horribly,
sucking, sucking, loth to lose its victim, but the
pull of rope and hands together counted. Gard
took a backward step and gained a few precarious
inches.</p>

<p class='c008'>A second time he stooped, and straightened, repeating
the performance again and again, until the
man lay upon the trampled path. Gard could use
his strength to better advantage now, and half lifting
the dead weight, he drew it back to the edge
of the sand.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man was barely conscious, but Gard laid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>him on the sloping bank and gave him a little
water from his canteen.</p>

<p class='c008'>It revived him somewhat, and was repeated, after
a moment. He was able to mumble now, begging
for more, which Gard gave him as fast as he dared,
till at last the poor fellow got to his hands and
knees, and was able, with help, to crawl slowly up
to the plain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here, Gard soaked a little cake of oat flour in
water, and fed him like a baby, but it was an hour
before he was able, after many attempts, to get
the man upon Jinny’s back.</p>

<p class='c008'>He could not sit erect, but Gard walked beside
him, supporting him, and the little cavalcade set
out for home. The rescued man was half delirious,
and muttered continually, between his pleadings
for water, of the heat; of thirst, and of the vultures.
Gard could not make out what particular
disaster had befallen him, but the empty canteen
slung at his back, and the absence of anything like
food, or of an outfit, was eloquent witness that a
desert tragedy had been averted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before they had gone far up the trail to the
glade the delirious muttering ceased; the man
swayed toward his rescuer until his head rested
upon the latter’s shoulder, and so they went on.
Whether he was asleep, or in a faint, Gard could
not tell.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“He’s had a tough pull, that’s certain, Jinny,”
he said, giving the burro an encouraging
pat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Could Jinny have spoken she might have said that
she was herself having a hard pull. She had often
carried Gard, on the plain, but this dead weight,
on an up-grade, was a brand-new surprise for her.
She wagged her solemn little head sorrowfully as
she plodded on, and not even the oat cake that
Gard reached forth to her seemed to impart any
charm to life as she then saw it.</p>

<p class='c008'>They reached the glade at last, and Gard got the
stranger upon his own bed, covering him with the
great bear-skin robe. He brought him nearly all
that was left of the deputy’s whiskey, cherished
carefully all these months, and set to preparing a
meal.</p>

<p class='c008'>He kicked aside the smoldering ashes of a nearly
burned out fire on the hard earth, and with a few
thrusts of a broad, flat stick, disclosed the earthen
jar of mesquite beans that he had left to cook in
his absence. Simmering with the beans were the
marrowbone of a deer and the carcass of a rabbit
caught that morning. The savory whiffs from the
steaming mess made the exhausted man on the bed
turn his face to the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How in all git out,” he began, feebly, and
stared in amazement; for Gard had flanked the
bean-pot with another, taken from the fire he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>quickly kindled by transferring the still smoldering
sticks from the bake-fire to the fireplace. The
visitor sniffed at this second pot, incredulously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where ’d you git coffee?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sweet acorns,” Gard explained, briefly. He
was tasting the full joy of hospitality as he brought
wild honey, and more oat cakes, from the shack.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stranger reached eager hands toward the
acorn coffee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gimme some—hot!” he pleaded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard filled a crooked earthen bowl with it and
brought it to him, steaming. He drained it, almost
savagely, handing the bowl back with a sigh of
satisfaction that left nothing for words to express.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Partner,” he said, his little close-set eyes taking
in the scene, wonderingly, “This is sure a great
layout. How’d ye find the place, an’ what’s yer
game?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I got up here by chance,” Gard said, evasively.
“I liked the spot, and so I’ve stayed along. My
name’s Gard,” he added, remembering that he had
not told it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mine’s Thad Broome,” the other replied, “an’
I’m runnin’ the hell of a streak o’ luck.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard had moved his little table up beside his
guest, and now he proceeded to serve his meal on
flat, clay plates of rather nondescript shape. He
had a fork and a spoon, rudely fashioned of wood,
and these he allotted to the stranger.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“Did you make everything ye’ve got?” Broome
demanded, examining them curiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very nearly,” was the reply, and the new-comer
began to eat, eagerly. At intervals, during
the meal, he told his story.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m a cowman myself,” he said, flinging a
bone out across the glade, “An’ if ever I git back
on the range ye kin fry me in skunk ile first time
ye ketch me off it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He took another great draught of the acorn
coffee, swearing, savagely, as he set the bowl down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Seems like I’d never git the taste o’ the desert
out’n my mouth again,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was with the ‘K bar C’ outfit,” he went on,
“Up Tusayan way. Know it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard shook his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then ye’re that much better off,” Broome said,
gloomily. “The grub was fierce; they was a foreman
that was seven hull devils all rolled in one,
an’ a range that’d drive ye crazy to ride. I was
mighty sick of it, a while along, an’ I met up with
a cuss one day that ’d bin out prospectin’ an’
struck it rich. So, bein’ a blame fool, I got the
fever.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He paused to watch his host, who was gathering
the remains of the meal and putting things shipshape
with a certain fine neatness that had become
the habit of Gard’s solitude.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“D’ye allus put on as much dog as that?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As much as what?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cleanin’ camp like an old maid school-ma’am,”
was the reply. “Jus’ you alone: wha’d ye bother
for?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It had to be that, or to go on all fours.” Gard
offered no further explanation. Thad Broome’s
type was familiar enough; he had foregathered
with it by many a camp fire. He had saved this
man from a horrible death, and the fellow was his
guest; yet he realized, with a feeling of shamed
hospitality, that Broome’s presence was irksome.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Been here long?” the latter asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Longer than it has seemed, maybe,” laughed
Gard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s a difference in things,” he added,
lightly. “I guess, now, the time you were down in
the quicksand seemed longer than it really was?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hell, yes!” Broome was launched again on
the stream of his troubles. He resumed the narrative,
sprinkling it liberally with oaths. He had
started out with a full equipment and a good
bronco, and the creature had “died on him,” a week
before, in the desert.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You should have had a burro,” Gard said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So they said. But I stuck to the idee of a
bronc. I ain’t no walkist.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“He didn’t last but three weeks,” he added, “an’
when he croaked the damned buzzards was on ’im
before I got out o’ sight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where were you going when you struck the
quicksand?” the other asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tryin’ to strike the railroad, afoot,” was the
reply. “It’s me fer ridin’ when I can. I said I
wan’t no walkist. I got turned ’round. I kep’
lightin’ load, an’ my grub gin out. Then I run
out o’ water.” He gave a shuddering gulp, and
continued:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I run round a lot, lookin’ fer’t, till I got in the
quicksand. That was just before you hollered, I
guess. But them buzzards was Johnny on the spot
the minute I was down. I most went mad with ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t you have a gun?” Gard asked. “Why
didn’t you fire it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gun? You bet yer life I had a gun. I fired all
my am-nition an’ then I fergit what. I guess I
threw the damned thing away. I got dotty, havin’
no water.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And there was good water within twenty feet
of you,” Gard said, musingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How’s that?” Broome’s tone was incredulous.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why didn’t you tap the nigger-head there by
the barranca?” his companion asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What—the big cactus like a green punkin?
What for?” Broome demanded, and Gard explained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>the nature of the bisnaga. If he had cut
off the top he would probably have found a quart
or two of water. Broome listened with curious
intentness, and when the other had finished, broke
into a torrent of execration.</p>

<p class='c008'>He cursed the desert in its nearness and its remoteness,
inclusively and particularly, for several
moments, until presently words seemed to fail him,
and the torrent of his oaths dribbled to an intermittent
trickle.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he finally paused for breath Gard sat as
though he had not heard, staring across the glade
at the fire, but Jinny, at his side, seemed all attention,
her long ears pricked forward, her sagacious
little visage turned full upon the stranger. There
was something disconcerting in the attitude of the
two, and Broome felt it, without comprehending it.
His voice trailed off weakly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mebby ye don’t like my remarks,” he said,
lamely, “I notice ye don’t cuss none yerself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t I?” Gard asked the question in all simplicity.
“I didn’t know it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Broome stared, uneasily, until the other was
constrained to take notice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess I do,” he laughed, half apologetically.
“I guess I swear as much as anybody, when I feel
so,” he added, “but I don’t feel so much—not
nowadays.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“Ye kin jus’ bet yer life,” blustered Broome,
with a show of being at ease, “that if ye’d bin
through what I have ye’d be ready to cuss the hull
blamed outfit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed loudly, as he spoke, but Gard was
replenishing the fire, and made no reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>Long hours after Broome was sleeping, exhausted,
his host sat before the glowing embers.
The day’s experiences had brought much to consider.</p>

<p class='c008'>For one thing, it was certain that the time had
arrived when he must return to civilization. He
could not keep Broome with him, even if the latter
wished to stay. He saw endless possibilities of
pain and trouble in such a partnership. And since
he could not keep him, he must himself go before
Broome had a chance to make any explorations.
His heart sank at the prospect.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s been mighty peaceful here, Jinny,” he
whispered to his faithful little comrade, who dozed
beside him in the firelight. “We’ll sure miss it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jinny shifted her weight in her sleep, and her
head drooped lower.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One thing, old girl,” Gard said, regarding her,
whimsically, “You don’t have to think about it. A
man’s different; he knows when he’s well off, and
hates to leave it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He glanced about him. The firelight touched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>fitfully the encircling trees, the great rocks, the
open door of the shack where Broome lay asleep,
the gleaming pool. Above in the violet depths,
blazed the dipper; how many times he had watched
it patrol the sky!</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hate to go,” he whispered, again, “I hate to
go, Jinny; but good as ’tis, I know it ain’t really
life. A man belongs with men. They may be
good or they may be bad; but a man’s got to take
’em as he meets up with ’em. He can’t be a real
man forever, just by himself.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The first touch of dawn saw Gard awake and
stirring. He went softly about the glade,
feeding Jinny in her little corral off at one side,
and preparing his own breakfast. The meal finished,
he left food where his guest could find it,
and made his way up the cañon. He had settled
in his own mind that if Broome was able to travel
they should leave the glade on the following day;
but there was first something that he must do.</p>

<p class='c008'>The forenoon was well advanced when Broome
stirred, opened his eyes and sat up with a start.
He was a moment or two realizing his surroundings
and recalling the events that had brought him
to this place.</p>

<p class='c008'>He sat staring at the cabin; at the rough mud-and-stone
walls; the primitive fireplace; the rude
furnishings, and finally summed up his impressions
in a phrase:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hell! What a layout!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, remembering Gard’s probable proximity,
he went heavily to the door.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>There was no one in sight. In the big outer
fireplace an “Indian” fire smoldered, guarded on
one side by the earthen coffee-pot, on the other by
the big kettle of beans. On the table were a bowl
and a plate; the former upside down over some
cakes of oat bread. Broome welcomed the sight,
for he was hungry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wonder where the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">patron</span></i> got to so early,” he
muttered as he fell upon the food.</p>

<p class='c008'>He ate swinishly, standing before the fire, and
had nearly completed his meal when he caught
sight of the inscription Gard had put upon the cup
from which he was drinking. His little shifty
eyes studied it curiously as he turned the cup
about.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What in tunk is that for?” he muttered, perplexed,
and when he had managed to decipher the
words he nearly dropped the little vessel in his
surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“T-h-e c-u-p o-f f-o-r-g-i-v-e-n-e-s-s,” he spelled
again, holding the cup up to the light and feeling
the sunken letters with one hard finger. “Rummy
kind o’ cup that’d be.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He stooped to refill it with “coffee” from the
blackened pot in the embers and, as he straightened
up, his eye met another inscription, on a broad
stone beside the door of the cabin. He read it
aloud, laboriously:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“<em>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose
mind is stayed on Thee.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Peace’—‘peace.’” Broome looked about him,
half dazed, groping in the void of his own spiritual
habitation for an explanation of what he saw.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s sure peace good an’ plenty in these
diggings,” he muttered, “if that’s what a man’s
aimin’ to locate; peace enough to drive him loco.
Guess that’s what ails him. He must be a jumpin’
luny to go scratchin’ round like this.... There’s
another one!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He espied it on the wall over the pallet where he
had slept.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>I will both lay me down in peace and sleep; for
Thou Lord only, makest me dwell in safety.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard had written that the day after the night of
terror when storm had devastated the glade; written
it remembering how his mother had taught it
to him, an imaginative little chap, afraid of the
dark. He had been saying his prayers one night,
beside his cot in the shed-chamber, when he became
afraid the SOMETHING was coming through the
gloom to grab him from behind as he knelt. His
mother, coming to tuck him up, found him cowering
under the blankets and winning from him the
secret of his fright, sat down beside him and taught
him the beautiful verse. Broome, reading it now,
experienced a feeling of dread.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“Peace again,” he growled, “I hope he gets
peace enough with all his bug-house slate-writing.
The feller’s hell on religion; shouldn’t wonder if
he was a preacher.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned away with an awed shiver.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gosh!” he ejaculated, “I’m glad I didn’t see
that over my head last night. I couldn’t a’ slept
a wink.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He went outside again to fill and drink another
cup of acorn coffee, and when his bodily hunger
was satisfied left the debris of his meal on the
hearth and wandered about the glade, seeking
gratification of his objective curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why!” he exclaimed, when he discovered
Jinny, in the corral, “The <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">patron</span></i> can’t be far off:
he’s left the burro!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He surveyed Jinny thoughtfully, as she stood at
the far side of the corral. Then he wandered over
to Gard’s rude pottery-factory.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like to know what the cuss is doin’ here,”
he thought. “He’s made his outfit from the
ground up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was struck by that as he continued his roving
scrutiny. Gard’s bow and arrows fairly frightened
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That fellow’s clean dotty,” he muttered.
“What in thunder kin a live man do with that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently he found the first knife Gard had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>fashioned, laid upon a ledge of the camp fireplace,
and turned it over like one bewildered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shivering spooks!” he swore, softly; “If this
<em>ain’t</em> an outfit! He don’t look like a ‘lunger,’” he
added, referring again to Gard; “nor this ain’t no
prospector’s layout; nor the cuss don’t seem locoed—not
altogether. It’s what I thought. He’s
some kind of a preacher. He don’t cuss none, an’
he seemed sorter quiet like last night. He didn’t
act just like it, though, neither.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Born of desire, another idea assailed him.
“Wonder where he keeps his whiskey,” he mused.
“That was a hell of a good sample he showed last
night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He began to search more systematically, still
keeping an alert eye for Gard’s possible return.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They ain’t no hiding-place outside,” he decided,
and turned his attention once more to the cabin.
He had no idea what sort of a receptacle to look
for, and a scrutiny of the corners revealed nothing.
He crossed the room, to the fireplace, and suddenly
gave a little start. He had made what promised
to be a discovery.</p>

<p class='c008'>He tiptoed to the door: no one was in sight, but
he stepped outside and again made the round of the
glade. Coming back, he took the precaution to
close the door when he reëntered the hut.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the fireplace again, he stooped and put both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>hands upon a stone half-way up one side of the
rude chimney. As he had foreseen, it came away
in response to a little lift—Gard’s hiding-place for
his treasure had been a most casual thing at best—and
a recess lay revealed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again Broome listened for sounds outside, ere
he lifted first one, then the other, of the two buckskin
bags that lay before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were not large; but they were very heavy,
and a peep into one revealed the yellow gleam that
he had expected.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little eyes glittered, and the man’s fingers
opened and shut, clawlike, but he closed the bag,
tying its buckskin string, and put it back. There
were some papers with the bags, but he would look
at those later.</p>

<p class='c008'>He fitted the stone back into place, scrutinizing
it keenly afterwards, to be sure that he had left no
signs of his meddling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The sneakin’ cuss!” he snarled, moving back
from the chimney. “He’s got a mine up here!
That’s what he was so sly about last night. He’s
gone there now, an’ he thinks he’ll keep me out of
it. I’ll bet he’s up there covering his tracks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was outside, now, muttering wrathfully.
“No ye don’t, my smart coyote,” he sneered, “Yer
kin just bet yer sweet life Thad Broome sits in this
game, sure!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>He went the rounds again, scouting eagerly, till
his trained plainsman’s eyes detected a faint trail
leading over the rocks at one side of the stream.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was but the suggestion of a pathway, trodden
by Gard’s moccasined feet, but it was enough for
the pryer’s sharpened senses. A moment later
Broome had skirted the pool, and was hot on the
scent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The trail grew clearer as he followed it, and he
pressed on, a growing rage in his heart, toward
the man who had found a good thing and was
keeping him out of it, after all that he had suffered.
Curiously enough, it was only his own part
in yesterday’s adventure that he remembered.
Gard’s agency in his rescue and present safety was
forgotten or ignored.</p>

<p class='c008'>Half an hour’s cautious travel, and his ear
caught a sound somewhere beyond. He crept on
stealthily from one sheltering boulder to another,
keeping carefully out of sight, until at last, clambering
upon a shelving rock, he peered down upon
Gard at work below him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cañon was very deep here, its walls towering,
bare and grim, hundreds of feet in air. A
great mass of piled-up rock nearly bridged the
stream, and Broome could plainly see the nature
of the vein that had been laid bare. Its promise
fairly made him gasp.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>He could see, as well, what Gard was doing.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the face of the rock, close beside the opening
where he had worked the claim, he had
scratched his location notice, roughly enough, with
his inadequate tools, but in letters perfectly legible,
defining clearly the boundaries of his claim as he
had staked it out.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having done this, he had gone over the letters
again, with charcoal, until they stared in inerasable
distinctness from the rock. Now he stood at a
little distance, regarding his finished work.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The damned, sneakin’ swine,” muttered the
watcher. “I’ll git even with him; he’s staked the
mother-lode.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He leaned forward eagerly to watch, as Gard
moved toward the opening in the rock. What was
he going to do next?</p>

<p class='c008'>He saw him stoop for something, and crept
nearer the edge of the rock, forgetful of concealment.
Attracted by some slight sound Gard suddenly
glanced up and looked the spy full in the
face. In an instant Broome had sprung upon him
and was clutching at the mattock which the other
had just picked up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think yer goin’ ter kill me with that, do yer?”
Broome snarled. “I’ll show yer!” He struck at
Gard’s eyes, at the same time striving to wrench
the tool from him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Half blinded by the onslaught, the other clinched,
instinctively, with his foe, and a grim battle began.</p>

<p class='c008'>Back and forth it raged, across the bit of sandy
floor at the base of the rocks, each man striving
for possession of the tool.</p>

<p class='c008'>Broome was powerfully built, and he had rested
from the agony of the day before. He was the
heavier of the two, and he fought with an insane
fury that pressed his antagonist back against the
cliff before Gard had well recovered from the
shock of his attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fiercely, silently the two struggled until Gard,
momentarily securing the mattock, flung it afar
upon the sand. Broome gave a shriek of savage
rage, and would have sprung for it, but the other
man closed upon him and caught him with one
powerful arm about the neck, pressing his face
earthward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Desperately Broome grasped the other’s body,
striving to break that iron hold, but Gard’s blood
was up, and he “saw red,” as his free arm rained
blows upon the other’s back.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strain as he would Broome could not break
free, nor trip his foe. The fellow seemed made of
iron, and the hammering of that fearful fist was
driving the breath from his body. He gathered his
forces for a last effort, but his breath already came
in gasps, and he sank in a heap upon the sand.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Gard hauled him to his feet, fiercely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stand up!” he shouted, as he faced him about.</p>

<p class='c008'>Broome would have fallen again, but Gard upheld
him, forcing him forward over the rocks, back
toward camp. Once he turned, as if he would
strike, but a glance at that fierce, set face herded
him on again, cowed and stumbling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are ye goin’ ter do to me?” he demanded,
at last, tortured by Gard’s silence. There
was no reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve as good a right in the cañon as you,”
Broome persisted. He was in that state of hysterical
strain that could not refrain from speech.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wouldn’t have touched ye if ye hadn’t come
at me with that pick,” he lied. Still not a word
from Gard, and Broome kept quiet till they
reached camp, and Gard produced a rope.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the same with which he had dragged the
fellow from the sand the day before; the loop that
had been about his body was still in one end. The
cowman shrieked when he saw it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are ye goin’ to do to me?” he screamed.
“By God! You tell me! What’s that thing fer?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He sprang upon Gard again, and was tossed
back like a child. A moment later he was lying
upon the ground, bound hand and foot, and Gard
towered above him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What am I going to do with you?” he asked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>in cold scorn; “What would you do to me, if I
was where you are?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Broome glared his hate, and fear. “Yah!” he
snarled, “I’d kill yer. I’ll kill yer yet, if yer don’t
look out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For reply the other gathered him up, dragged
him into the cabin and threw him upon the bed
there. Then he went outside.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard was in a state of amazement. He looked
at his own brown hands, and rolling up a sleeve
of his buckskin shirt gazed upon his own right
arm, lean, sinewy, knotted with iron muscles. He
contracted, then relaxed it, slowly, and finally
struck himself a resounding blow on the chest.
Then he laughed, under his breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And all this time,” he said, in a sort of wonder,
“I’ve thought I was a rather sick man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He walked over to the corral where Jinny’s
shaggy head showed over the barrier. There was
keen joy in his swift stride, and in the new sense
of power, and physical well-being, that filled him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jinny,” he said, tweaking one of the long ears
pricked forward to welcome him, “I guess the
right place for me is here in the corral.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He regarded the little burro thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hate to break it to you, old girl,” he went on,
“But you’ve got to carry that load of dirt and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>poison down to the desert again. It’s the only
way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned again and busied himself about the
camp, clearing away the debris of Broome’s meal,
and putting the place to rights. He brought out
the largest of his willow baskets, one that he had
made to fit Jinny’s back, and proceeded to fill it
from his food-stores. Broome, within the shack,
watched his movements whenever he came within
range, but he had learned his lesson, and asked no
questions. Later in the day Gard brought him
food, and released his hands that he might eat,
but neither man spoke, and when Broome had
finished eating his captor bound him again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dusk was falling when Gard next came into the
cabin. He had changed his buckskin garments for
those he had worn two years before. He had been
saving them for such a day of need.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going to untie your feet,” he said to
Broome, “and you’re coming outside.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He did as he had said, and Broome followed
him out.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jinny stood there, equipped with a home-made
bridle and a sort of saddle of deer-skin. Leaning
against a rock was a hamper closely packed. Gard
had put out the big camp fire and the place already
wore an air of desolation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Inside the cabin, alone, Gard looked about with
poignant regret.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s sure time to go,” he told himself, sorrowfully,
“But I hate to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned to the hiding-place in the chimney
and secured the buckskin bags, and the papers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s <em>that</em> to attend to, too,” he murmured,
fumbling the rumpled and stained sheets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s been a good place,” he thought, as he shut
the door of the shelter, and looked about outside.
“To think what I was when I came here. Whatever&#160;... yes, it’s the truth: it’s been the making
of me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He came and stood beside Broome.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You get on the burro,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man demurred. “I’d rather walk,” he objected.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t ask you what you’d rather do,” was
the reply. Gard was in no mood to bandy words,
and a look at his face convinced the other that
obedience was best.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he was settled Gard proceeded to blindfold
him, whereat the cowman swore fiercely under
his breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll tell you now, Broome,” Gard said, when
he felt sure that the blindfold was secure, “You’ve
got nothing to be afraid of long ’s you behave
yourself. I won’t leave you in the desert, but I’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>run no risk of your ever finding your way back
here. You wear that blind till I see fit to take it
off, and that’ll be when we’re good and well away
on the plain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He shouldered the willow hamper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come along, Jinny,” he said, without looking
around again, and in the gathering dusk the outfit
took its way down the dry wash to the desert.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>It was supper-time at the Sylvania Palace Grille.
Sylvania was an outfitting town for prospectors
and cow-punchers, and the occupants of the little
oilcloth-covered tables in the “Grille” were almost
exclusively of these two classes. The telephone
operator and the express-agent had already taken
their meal, and their departure, and this was not
the day for the tri-weekly stage, the driver of
which sometimes patronized Mrs. Hallard’s rotisserie.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sing Fat and Sing Gong, the two Chinese waiters,
slipped about attending to the demands of
patrons, and Mrs. Hallard herself, from behind a
counter, kept tabs on the room and set out the
liquid refreshments that the various customers
called for.</p>

<p class='c008'>The place was full of noise and bustle. The
rattle of heavy crockery, the clink of steel knives
and forks, the raking of boots and spurs over the
plank floor, the clamor of voices and the monotonous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>sing-song of the two Chinese calling orders
to the cook, made up a medley in which, Mrs. Hallard
was wont to declare, she could hardly hear
herself think.</p>

<p class='c008'>Despite this handicap, however, very little escaped
her. She managed to hear, with no apparent
difficulty, Steve Salton’s gently preferred request
that she “chalk up” the amount of his bill, and to
catch his mumbled replies to her swift interrogatories
as to his prospects for paying.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s all right if you’re going to have it,” she
said, with business-like crispness. “But I ain’t
here for my health, you know. I want to see the
color of your dust before too long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s reasonable,” was Steve’s reply. “You’ll
see yer pay O. K. soon&#160;’s I locate, an’ I’m bound to
when—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cut it out!” Mrs. Hallard was already pushing
change across the counter to another customer.
“It’s chalked up, Steve.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kate! oh, Kate!” The voice of an old habitué
came across the bedlam of sound: “Tell one o’
them pigtailed lumps o’ sin,” it went on, “to fetch
me another pony o’ that white pizen o’ your’n,
quicker!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gong,” the presiding genius of the place said
calmly to one of the China boys, “Go tell Tombstone
he don’t need no more gin. Tell ’im I said so.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Gong carried the message, delivering it over his
shoulder as he set another customer’s order of
“ham and” before him. Tombstone’s face, when
he received it, was worthy of his name.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hell!” he ejaculated to anyone who might
listen, “That’s what comes o’ hashin’ off ’n a
woman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was still muttering gloomily when he went
up to the desk to pay his score.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kate,” he said with drunken gravity, as he
swayed before her, “The love o’ tyranny’s a bad
thing in a man. It’s plumb perilous fer a female.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Hallard glanced from his money to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s eatin’ you, Tombstone?” she demanded,
ringing up the cash-register.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’T ain’t me. It’s you, The love o’ power air
devourin’ you to that extent you can’t serve a man
his rations without cuttin’ ’em short. It were
plumb tyrannical in you to send me that there message
about the gin.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Hallard’s handsome black eyes surveyed
him coldly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When a gent’s that far in he goes howlin’
a lady’s Christian name in public like you done just
now,” she said, “it’s a sign he don’t need no more
at present. There’s your change, Tombstone.
Now vâmose!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jake Lowrey!” she sent her voice level across
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the reeking room to where a big, shaggy miner
was disputing with one of the Chinamen, “This
here’s an eatin’-house. ’T ain’t a cussin’ bee. If
you don’t like the victuals served you, you know
what you kin do. But while you’re in here you
quit swearin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ain’t a cussin’ fer cussin’s sake,” the big miner
pleaded, above the laughter of the others. “I’m
only inquirin’ into the nature o’ this here sunny-side
Fat’s fetched me with my hash.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What color is it?” the proprietor of the eating-house
asked, and the egg on Jake’s plate immediately
became the center of all attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s yeller,” its owner called, surveying it
critically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Naw ’t ain’t neither; it’s red,” another observer
decided.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a lie. It’s just the color of an orange, an’
oranges is yeller, ain’t they?” This from a third
critic.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If it’s yeller it’s a new-laid egg,” Mrs. Hallard
pronounced, judicially. “If it’s red, it’s a
fresh egg. Any other hen-fruit in this place is
ranch eggs, unless it’s chickens, an’ we don’t serve
them on the half-shell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>During the silence that followed this elucidation
of the egg question the outside door of the place
opened hesitatingly, and a young Mexican girl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>looked in. Mrs. Hallard nodded, and she entered,
leading by the hand a blind countryman who carried
a guitar. The pair were evidently well known
to Mrs. Hallard’s patrons, and through the thick
cloud of tobacco smoke that filled the room a number
of the men shouted their greetings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Buenos noches</span></i>, Conchita.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Howdy, Buttercup.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Put her here, ’Chita!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl responded to each greeting with a flash
of white teeth. A number of new-comers flocked
in after her, finding seats and shouting their orders
to the China-boys.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on, ’Chita, hit ’er up!” some one called.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl had guided her companion to a chair, and
the latter now twanged a few notes upon his guitar.
Presently Conchita began to dance, slowly, at first,
gradually quickening the pace, as she flitted back
and forth in the little open space before the counter.</p>

<p class='c008'>By degrees this space became too confined for
her movements, and she drifted, like a bit of thistledown,
along the aisles between the tables.</p>

<p class='c008'>When she came opposite Jake Lowrey she gave a
quick little leap and sprang upon the table before
him, where she pirouetted among the bottles of
condiments, and the tall glass of beer over which
he was lingering. She skirted them all, daintily,
her twinkling feet never still.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Suddenly she paused, balancing marvelously
upon one toe, the other outstretched before the
man. Lowrey’s hand was already in his pocket,
now it came out holding a silver coin which he
placed upon the outstretched toe. In an instant it
was snapped into the air and caught by the whirling
dancer as it came down. A chorus went up
from the assembly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here y’ are, Conchita!” “You know me,
’Chita.” “Put ’er here, little gal!” The men bid
openly for the dancer’s favor, making haste to
clear their tables as an inducement for her to
notice them.</p>

<p class='c008'>She sprang from Jake’s table to another, across
the aisle, and repeated her graceful, agile performance,
weaving in and out among the dishes, kissing
her fingers and smiling. Thus she wandered from
table to table, picking her favorites and taking toll
of each, going wilfully, it seemed, from silver lure
held plainly in sight, to tables where much less was
offered.</p>

<p class='c008'>In and out she flashed, now here, now there,
until it became apparent to all that she was working,
step by step, toward the one table whose occupant
had extended no invitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>This one was in a corner of the room, and at it
sat a young man who was to all appearances
neither a prospector nor a cowboy, though he wore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>a certain indefinable air of the plain. It showed in
the bronze of his face, where it was not covered
by a crisp brown beard, of a cut not worn by the
usual desert-dweller; in his big, strong, tanned
hands, that were supple and deft, despite the marks
of hard work upon them, and in the steady, farseeing
gaze of his brown eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little dancer was close to the stranger’s
table now, and bending low to avoid a hanging
lamp, she sprang upon it, and calling something to
the guitar-player, set her feet a-twinkle through
a bewildering maze of perfectly calculated steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>She glided about the edge of her tiny stage; she
blew lightly across it; she whirled madly in the
centre of it. Everyone in the room gazed, spell-bound,
realizing that their pet dancer was outdoing
herself on this occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Through it all the girl’s eyes never left the face
that was upturned to her gaze, the brown eyes regarding
her with a sort of consideration that no
others in the room had shown. Admiration, challenge,
desire, those other eyes had betrayed, but
these were different. Their quiet questioning held
no reproach; they were full of friendliness, and of
interest, and the coin that was presently laid upon
her out-thrust toe was cheerfully, even gaily proffered,
but the girl suddenly felt that both the interest
and the gaiety were different from her own.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>She tossed the silver dollar in air and caught it,
with a nod of thanks. Then she sprang to the
floor and ran up the aisle to where the blind Mexican
still strummed his guitar strings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Este bestante!</span></i>” she cried, pouring her earnings
into his deep-crowned hat. “<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">No mas.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>She kissed her fingers gaily to the applauding
men and turned toward the door. Only Kate Hallard’s
keen eyes noted, without seeming to see, that
she had knotted one silver coin into a corner of her
kerchief, and slipped it into her bosom.</p>

<p class='c008'>No more visitors came into the Palace Grille.
Sylvania had supped, and the men at the tables
one by one came forward when the girl had gone,
to pay their bills and slip out into the street. In
the shortest of five minutes all were gone save the
stranger in the corner, and the two Chinese, who
padded softly about, putting the place to rights.</p>

<p class='c008'>Kate Hallard had seen the stranger throughout
mealtime. She noted, moreover, that he had more
than one glance for her, the while he sat taking
his supper in a deft, dainty way that some men get
from much eating out of doors.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was accustomed to being watched. More
than one habitué of the place had taken his turn
at gazing at her, during the year that she had been
running the Palace Grille. She was not unpleasant
to look at, if a man were not over-sensitive about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>some things. She had an abundance of fair hair
that was not bleached, despite the contrast of her
black, long-lashed eyes. They were handsome
eyes, if bolder and harder than they might have
been if life itself had been less hard and bold for
this woman of the desert.</p>

<p class='c008'>That it <em>had</em> been hard was told by the cold,
steady gaze of the dark eyes; by the worn line of
the cheek, and by the half contemptuous, half tolerant
set of thin lips that ought still to be full, and
curved, and red.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she glanced over at the stranger, when both
the boys were out of the room, he left his seat and
came down to the counter. He was taller than she
had thought, she noted, and very slender. Despite
this latter fact, however, he gave an impression of
more than usual strength and activity. “He’d be
one blame hard man to down,” she thought, in the
instant before he was leaning upon the counter,
tendering the price of his meal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This must be a mighty uncomfortable life for a
woman,” he said in a matter of fact way, watching
her register the payment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mebby,” she answered, shortly. He spoke
again, with a sort of gentle persistence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shouldn’t think you’d care much about it?”
There was a questioning quality in his voice, that
Mrs. Hallard felt would presently win an answer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>whether she would or no. She went on “ridding
up” the counter, and set a bottle of “square-face”
back on the shelf behind her, with rather unnecessary
energy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t know as my caring about it would make
any difference,” she finally said. “Leastways it
never made none to me, an’ I guess it needn’t to
nobody else.” This last was said with some significance
of emphasis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” the stranger spoke half absently.
“But I’d have thought,” he continued, looking up,
“that you would have preferred to keep to the
range.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A startled look came into the hard black eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?” Kate Hallard cried.
“What do <em>you</em> know about the range? Who be
you, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you sell it?” the stranger persisted, ignoring
her questions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sell it!” she burst out, shrilly. “If you know
anything about it, you know I never got a chance
to sell it. It melted; it never got to be mine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her voice had risen until the sound brought Sing
Fat in from the kitchen to observe. Seeing this,
she lowered it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look a’ here, Mister,” she said, sharply, “If
you’re as wise as you’re tryin’ to make out, you
know how I got done outer the range.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“I honestly don’t know,” was the reply. “I
found your deed, and I’ve been hunting you up
to give it to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She stared at him, in a sort of awe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You found that deed?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes; I have it. But how did you lose the property?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She left off her desultory arranging of bottles,
and leaned toward him, across the counter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hallard bought the range off’n an Easterner
named Oliphant,” she began. “He was goin’ to
stock it, an’ then you’d never a’ seen me here.
He’s got the deed all square, an’ he leaves it with
me till he goes down to Phoenix to record it.
Then he goes and gits killed bustin’ an outlaw
horse fer Hod Granger, and leaves me to manage
fer myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The stranger uttered a little murmur of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you had the deed,” he suggested, as Mrs.
Hallard seemed lost in thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes! I had it all right. But I give it to
Frank Arnold to record fer me. He was goin’
down to Phoenix, an’ I guess they was some hoodoo
onto it; fer Frank, he got killed too—got killed
in a cloudburst—an’ when they found his body
every bone in it was broke an’ they was hardly a
rag onto it. So the deed was lost.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“But surely this man Oliphant would have made
it right for you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would he though? That’s where you ain’t
guessin’ right.” Mrs. Hallard’s laugh had no
mirth in it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what they told me,” she said. “An’ so
I see a lawyer, an’ he undertakes to write Oliphant,
that’s gone back east. But after a spell he comes
an’ tells me the sneakin’ thief’s gone an’ sold that
prop’ty twice, an’ cleared out. Think o’ that, will
you, an’ him a old, old man.... Out here fer his
health, he was. Lord! if he don’t need a hotter
climate ’n even this is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Was the second deed recorded?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet your life it was. The man that’d
bought it saw to that, an’ he didn’t have the luck
to git killed, neither.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must say he tried to act decent, though,” Mrs.
Hallard added, “but o’ course he’d paid his money
fer the prop’ty, same ’s Ed Hallard did, an’ Ed, he
paid twelve thousand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I know.” The stranger had the deed in
his hand. “What did the man do for you?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well: not much, but mebby he wouldn’t a’ done
that if it hadn’t bin fer Mr. Westcott—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>Who</em> did you say?” The stranger’s gentle
voice suddenly sharpened to keen interest.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“Ash Westcott. He was my lawyer,” Mrs. Hallard
explained.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was he who told you about the second sale?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure! How else ’d I know?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see.” He stood pondering her story until at
last she took up the tale again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Westcott—he talked it over with the man
that bought it. I didn’t have nothin’ but my word
to back me; an’ as he told me, I really couldn’t
make a claim, an’ I didn’t have no case to go after
Oliphant with. But the other feller he give me
three hundred dollars fer a quit claim, an’ that set
me up here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You gave a quit claim?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just to make the man feel easy. Westcott said
it’d be the best way. He was mighty kind about
raisin’ the money fer me. I hadn’t a red after I’d
settled up Ed’s debts an’ small matters.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here’s your deed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She took it, eagerly, and they pored over it together.
The stranger pointed to a signature at the
end of the acknowledgment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you know that man?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>She studied the name. “Never hearn of him,”
she said, “What’s he got to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He was the notary before whom the deed was
acknowledged,” was the reply. “If we could get
hold of him we might learn something, and I think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>it would pay you to try to find out something
from Oliphant.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know where he is,” was the bitter response,
“an’ if I did, I tell you I ain’t got a cent
to do anything with. I ain’t more ’n makin’ a
livin’ here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess that could be fixed,” the stranger said.
“I’ve got some.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked him over, fixedly, with her black
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“An’ where do you come in?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>He laughed, ever so gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not figuring about that,” he answered.
“But if I were you, and could get hold of the money
to do it, I’d try and see this thing through; and,”
he added, significantly, “I guess I’d hunt up some
other lawyer than this Mr. Westcott.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He met her gaze without hesitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s some folks does say Westcott’s sharp,”
she said, slowly. “Be you one of ’em?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man smiled, without speaking.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe it,” Kate Hallard mused. “He
wouldn’t dare. Besides,” she added, after a little
thought, “he’d a known he was fair skinnin’ me,
and he was the one tried to see to it I had a little
money out’n it. He wouldn’t a’ taken my last
nickel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A strange look came into the man’s face.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“Maybe he didn’t spend much time reflecting on
that,” he said, slowly. “Anyway, if I were you
I’d see about it, and I guess the money can be
found.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You ain’t told me yet who you be,” Kate Hallard
remarked, studying him narrowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My name is Gabriel Gard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Mister Gabriel Gard,” she said, “I never
hearn of <em>you</em> before, an’ I ain’t sure I understand
as well ’s I wanter before I make any deals.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can trust me,” Gard said, simply, meeting
her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And this Westcott,” she exclaimed, sharply,
“If he’s done me so! If he has—”</p>

<p class='c008'>She gripped the counter, her teeth showing, savagely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Easy!” said Gard quietly, “Better keep cool.
The man ain’t worth riling yourself up over. Besides,
I believe we can do something, with this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He touched the deed, and she picked it up again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to try to get hold of Oliphant,” he began,
outlining his plan, “and this notary, Arthur
Sawyer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Kate Hallard regarded him with an unwonted
expression of mingled helplessness and perplexity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oliphant’s gone back east as I said,” she answered,
“An’ this here Sawyer ’s new to me. I
never knew nothing about him.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Gard stood considering, a long sequence of unexpected
difficulties developing itself before his
mind. He had found the Hallard deed among the
deputy’s papers, and had kept it carefully, against
such time as he could restore it to the owner. His
first act after leaving Broome, when the pair
reached the railroad track, had been to go to Yuma.
Here he acquired the habiliments of civilization,
and found a temporary home for Jinny. He had
stopped in Tucson long enough to file his claim
there, and then set about finding the Edward Hallard
to whom the deed referred. It was a matter
of a fortnight before his inquiries revealed the fact
of Ed Hallard’s death, and the whereabouts of his
widow. Now he had no way of judging how long
it might be before he could strike the trail of this
unknown Arthur Sawyer who had taken the acknowledgment
of the deed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In any event, he realized that the delay meant
postponement of certain cherished plans of his
own; perhaps danger to them. He had met a
man at Yuma, and another in Tucson, who had
known him as Barker, and though they had not
recognized him, so greatly was he changed, still
he could not ignore the possibility that any day
someone might remember him. Until his plans
were perfected, the territory was perilous ground
for him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>He frowned a moment, lost in thought; then he
squared his shoulders and met Mrs. Hallard’s gaze
with eyes that were full of steady peace. He had
made up his mind. His own matters must wait
until he had straightened out this woman’s tangle
of wrong.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve got to find this man Sawyer,” he repeated,
“And I hardly know where to begin trailing
him. We’ve got to get hold of Westcott, too;
you say he’s at Tucson?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He lives there,” was the reply; “or did last I
knew. I ain’t heard from him in a long time now.
No need to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well: I guess the best thing to do first, is to
write to him. You tell him you’ve found your
deed: no need to say how. We’ll see what he’s
got to say, and—” There was the least perceptible
hesitation, “if he comes up here, and you want me
to,” he continued evenly, “I’ll talk with him for
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Hallard looked relieved.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re mighty good,” she cried, “Fact is I’m
afraid&#160;... you see, I....”</p>

<p class='c008'>The outer door was pushed open and a big
Mexican vaquero put in his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s up, Manuel?” Mrs. Hallard asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vaquero hesitated: “<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">No mas</span></i> supper?” he
said, tentatively.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“Supper all right,” was the reply. “You’re
late, Manuel. What you doin’ off the range?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Mexican made a laughing gesture, crooking
up his elbow. Mrs. Hallard frowned, noting his
condition.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t git no booze here,” she said, “You’ve
had enough. Fat’ll bring you some coffee an’ you
eat a meal an’ git back on the range. You had
trouble enough last time, I should think.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fellow sat down, shamefacedly, and Sing
Fat came in to serve him. A moment later another
customer entered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s always the way it goes,” Kate Hallard
commented, “One straggler always brings another.
They’ll come dribblin’ in now, one at a
time, till closin’-time.... But I say, Mr. Gabriel
Gard, don’t you go thinkin’ I don’t appreciate
what you’ve done. I’ll write Westcott like you
say, an’ mebby it’ll come out all right; but I ain’t
much hopeful of it. Things don’t, much, outside
o’ story books.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The hard look was in her face again. Gard met
it with his steady smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You watch this one come out right,” said he.
“I guess things mostly are right, if we could see
’em straight.” He was turning toward the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re liable sometimes to pick ’em up by the
wrong end,” he added. “We’ll find out which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the right end of this before we lift it, and then—”
the smile deepened, and included the dark eyes—“Then
we’ll lift,” he called back as he closed the
door behind him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sylvania’s one business street was lighted only
by the stars, and the feebler rays that shone from
a few illuminated windows. In the yellow glare
from one of these a group of cowboys were dismounting
by the rail of Jim Bracton’s Happy
Family Saloon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Howdy, Stranger,” one of them called, as he
stumbled against Gard on reaching the ground,
“Excuse <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He glanced a second time at Gard’s face and
smiled, genially. “Thinkin’ o’ minglin’ up in this
mad whirl?” he asked, “Come on.” And together
they entered the precincts of the Happy Family.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The scene in which Gard found himself was of a
sort he had known familiarly enough in years
past. The low-ceilinged shanty, rough-boarded and
blackened; the sawdust-strewn floor, the painted
bar with its distorting mirror and motley array of
bottles, and even the faces of the men showing
duskily through the smoke-veiled light of flaring
coal-oil lamps, seemed to him like details of a half-forgotten
dream.</p>

<p class='c008'>The evening was fairly begun and the place was
filling. A group of prospectors near the bar were
listening derisively to the brand-new theory one of
their number was propounding, regarding the
whereabouts of the lost Peg-leg mine. At the
farther end of the room the thump of a broken-down
wheel-of-fortune and the monotonous calls of
its manipulator, proclaimed the occupation of the
crowd of Mexicans gathered there. Some cowboys
at a table near the door were engaged in a
game of dominoes, and beyond them three or four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>men were playing poker. Gard noticed with some
surprise that one man of this group was an Indian,
who seemed to be betting freely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That there’s old Joe Papago,” the cowboy who
had come in with him volunteered, noting his
glance. “Old Joe, he’s the best-fixed Injun ’round
here. I hearn he sold ten head o’ beef cows over t’
Tucson, yesterday, an’ got his money. Must ’a’
got whiskey, too, by the looks of ’im.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He put a foot on the bar rail and surveyed the
scene tolerantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s a mighty ornery bunch o’ human buzzards
hangs out in this town o’ Sylvania,” he said,
candidly. “But a feller’s gotter pass some time in
social pursuits now ’n again, an’ he has to take his
kind as he meets up with ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard was still recently enough from solitude to
thrill with the sense of human companionship.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’T ain’t always the roughest looking ones that
are the worst,” he suggested, sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s where you’re shoutin’.” The cow-puncher
brought a big fist down emphatically.
“For all right hell,” he said, “a real polished gent
can give these chaps cards an’ spades an’ beat ’em
to the devil when he tries. We had one here last
year, a gent that played cards—played ’em too
damn well fer his own health, finally. But he was
that polished in his manners as I ever went anywheres
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>to see, an’ he could lie in five different languages.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir,” he added, meditatively, “five different
kinds o’ mortal human conversations that feller
had a cinch onto; an’ he couldn’t behave hisself in
ary one of ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What you havin’?” he suddenly broke off to
ask, as the barkeeper signified his readiness to attend
to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m drinking lemonade,” Gard said, and the
cow-puncher took another look at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gimme the same,” he finally told the barkeeper,
with serious politeness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mebby I’d oughter beg your pardon”; he
turned to Gard with a look of anxiety on his
face. “I reckon I was a little careless in my talk if
you happen to be a sin-buster.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A what?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sin-buster. You sabe bronco-buster, don’t you;
an’ trust-buster?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, sure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well then, ain’t sin-buster plain United States?
It’s what a preacher-feller oughter be if he’s on
his job, ain’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess it is,” was Gard’s reply, “but I’m not a
preacher. I just haven’t been drinking much of
late years, and don’t know ’s I care to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! that’s it? Well lemonade ’s pretty good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>stuff,” the cow-puncher said, cheerfully. “I can’t
seem to remember when I’ve had none, but I
reckon it’ll taste first rate. I ordered it thinkin’
you was maybe religious.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He finished a little ruefully, with a questioning
inflection on the last words. Gard laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not, I guess,” he said, “leastways not so ’s
to hurt me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s good,” the cow-puncher nodded, approvingly,
“Though religion don’t hurt a good
person,” he added, meditatively.</p>

<p class='c008'>He removed his broad-brimmed felt hat and
peered into the crown. His head was thatched with
close-cropped, grizzly-gray hair; his face was
tanned and seamed by wind and weather, thin-lipped
and stern as to the mouth, under his short
moustache, with steadfast blue eyes that had the
plainsman’s and the sailor’s trick of vigilance. It
was a face to be trusted—shrewd, honest, capable,
yet full of a simplicity that was almost childlike.
Gard found himself warming to the fellow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you belong about here?” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure. My name’s Sandy Larch. I’m foreman
out ’t the Palo Verde, below here. Know the
range?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard admitted that he did not. “I’m new ’round
here,” he explained, as he told his name.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“I’m looking for a man,” he added, tentatively,
“a notary named Sawyer: Arthur Sawyer. Ever
hear of him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sandy Larch reflected, repeating the name
thoughtfully. “Was he a lunger?” he finally asked,
“A little feller, with broken wind, an’ a cough that
’d drive you wild to hear?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know.” The description took Gard’s
memory back to the days when he, too, had had
such a cough. “I never saw him,” he explained,
“But I’m mighty anxious to get hold of him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There was a man up in the Navajo country,”
Sandy continued, “Where the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">patron</span></i> was runnin’
the Bar Circle G. He stayed ’round quite a considerable,
doctorin’ his lungs. Then the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">patron</span></i> sold
out up there; he had this range too, in them days;
an’ I ain’t never seen this Sawyer chap down this
way. The <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">patron</span></i> might tell you. Know him—Morgan
Anderson?”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a name well known in the territory. Gard
had seen its owner once or twice, in the old
days. He said something of the sort to the cow-puncher.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s away just now,” the latter told him; “but
he’ll be back in a few days, an’ you can ask him.
I’d know whatever did become o’ that chap....
Look a’ there, will you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He glanced over to where the men were playing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>poker. One of them had reached over and pulled
a big brown flask from the Papago’s coat-pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Time you treated us to a drink, Joe,” he said,
with a half-insolent air of fellowship.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Indian nodded, smiling vacuously, and the
bottle went around the table, each man helping
himself. When it came back to its owner he rose
with it, and crossed to the door, going out into the
street. The men at the table looked at one another
with a grin and one of them examined the hand of
cards that the Indian had left behind him. He had
just laid it down again when the Papago came
back, and the game was resumed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wouldn’t that rattle your slats now?” Sandy
Larch asked, disgustedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Joe,” he continued, “don’t dast drink even his
own lickker in here. It’s agin the law for an Indian;
an’ Jim Bracton wouldn’t stand fer ’t; he
goes outside to take a drink, while them buzzards
swills it in here, right before him; an’ they’re gittin’
his wad, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard made no reply. He had more than once
glanced at the group, while he and the foreman
were talking, and now he watched them interestedly,
an intent look in his deep eyes. A moment
later he had turned, and was moving toward the
players.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thinkin’ o’ sittin’ in?” Sandy Larch asked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>jestingly. “They’s sure need of an honest-notioned
man to deal them cards. But it’d be ticklish
business.... Good Lord!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was staring in earnest, now, and instinctively
reached for the gun in his back-pocket, though
he did not draw it. The stranger had approached
the poker-players, and stood over them, his big,
empty hands outspread upon the table before them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The men whom he had interrupted looked up in
surprise. The prospectors who had been discussing
the Peg-leg suddenly became silent. The dominoe-players
ceased the rattle of their game and
stared. A hush was upon the whole room, a tense
feeling of pending excitement. One or two men
instinctively measured their own distance from the
door, and from the center of coming activities.
Jim Bracton stared open-mouthed from behind his
bar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is the feller?” he demanded. “Friend o’
yourn, Larch?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not that I knows,” was the foreman’s reply.
“I never saw him before, but I’m sure willin’ to
sit in to any game where he holds a hand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He started forward, ready to draw on the instant,
but the stranger seemed not to see him. He
had gathered the eyes of the poker-players in his
own indignant gaze, and now addressed them collectively:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“Gentlemen,” he said, quietly, “you ought not to
be doing this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Glory be!” groaned Sandy Larch under his
breath, “now wha’ d’ you think o’ that fer a simple
speech?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The astounded men to whom Gard spoke sat
silent, not one of them making a move. They were
held spell-bound by the gentle quality of his fearlessness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Somebody ’s been breaking the law, and selling
this Indian whiskey,” Gard went on, in a matter-of-fact
tone. “It was a mighty bad thing to do, and
you are doing something a heap wickeder. He is
drunk now, and he doesn’t rightly sense what he’s
doing. You ought not to play cards with him.
You’re drinking his liquor and helping him to get
drunker; and—<em>you’re cheating him, out of his
money</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The big wheel-of-fortune had ceased to whirr
now, and the silence of the room was broken only
by a snarling question from one of the men Gard
had addressed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What in hell o’ your business is it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s every man’s business when another man
breaks the law,” was the quiet reply. “You’d better
quit playing now, friend,” Gard continued,
turning to the Papago. “You’d better quit right
off, while you’ve got something left, and go home.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“You stay where you be, Joe,” growled the man
who had asked the question. “Don’t you climb out
fer no tenderfoot. I’ll settle the—”</p>

<p class='c008'>He stopped speaking as the stranger’s eyes
blazed full upon him for an instant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You go <em>now</em>, Joe,” Gard said, in a low, even
voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like a man in a dream old Joe rose, slipping into
his pocket the coins he had been about to put into
the game when Gard interfered. The tenseness of
the situation had brought him to some measure of
sobriety, and he did not reel as he left the room.
A moment later the patter of his pony’s unshod
feet came to the listening ears within.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard still held the other men in a gaze that
seemed to search and estimate the hidden thought
of each.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now they’ll kill him, sure,” Sandy Larch
thought, slipping nearer, but the stranger took no
notice of him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Friends,” he said, breaking at last the tense
silence that ruled the room, “There’s a law against
making an Indian drunk, and there’s a law against
robbing him. They’re white men’s laws; and
white men ought to keep ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It ain’t right”; he went on, still leaning upon
the table, and the men listened, as if hypnotized.
“There’s things a man can’t do without getting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>lower down than any man wants to be, and cheating
a drunken Indian is one of ’em. That’s the
truth of it. You ought not to do it, and when you
do somebody’s got to make you stop. That’s why
I interfered.... There ain’t any reason though,”
he added, as if an after thought, “why you
shouldn’t go on with your game, now; I’m going
to say good-night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He straightened up, and turning his back upon
the group walked quietly toward the door. Half-a-dozen
men were ready, now, to draw in his defense,
but there was no need. Not a man of those whom
he had brought to book moved. They sat like
men dazed, until the door had closed upon Gard;
then, with an oath, one of them seized upon the
cards.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What th’ Almighty ’s the matter with you
fools?” he growled. “Whose deal is it, anyhow?
Git int’ the game, you. This ain’t no damned kindergarten!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They resumed their playing, sullenly, and the
spell upon the room was broken. Sandy Larch
wiped his damp forehead upon a huge red handkerchief,
and turned to the bar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jim,” he said, feebly, “set down that there bottle
o’ whiskey, will ye? I sure need it in my
business right now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He measured a liberal potion and swallowed it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“An’ he said he wa’nt no sin-buster,” he muttered.
“He sure was on the job, though.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But wa’nt that a sweet line o’ talk to hand out
to men folks, Jim? How’d it come they didn’t
kill ’im?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Search me,” was the barkeeper’s reply. “I had
my gun all limbered. I sure expected the place ’d
be shot up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He tells ’em it wasn’t right,” Sandy mused,
absently refilling his glass. “He tells them b-a-a-d
men <em>’twasn’t right</em>! An’ there they sits, like they
was throwed an’ hog-tied, while he turns ’round
his back to ’em an’ walks out like they ain’t a thing
on earth to be afraid of. Lord! He can have me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He drained his glass and departed, leaving the
Happy Family to its own devices.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard, meantime, had walked out beyond the
town to the open desert. His spirit was full of
trouble, hot with indignation at what he had seen,
oppressed with a sense of the complexity of the life
into which he was so suddenly plunged. It was
hard to realize that the still, bright stars above him
were shining, as well, upon the clean peace that
dwelt in the glade. His thoughts turned thither
like homing birds, and he walked on across the
cactus-dotted sands, until he could look toward the
shadowy bulk of the far mountains, visible in the
marvelous desert starlight. Somewhere in that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>direction, he knew, the glade lay, and gradually a
feeling came to him of quiet, and of renewing
strength. He was able to think calmly of the sudden
complication in his plans, and to consider the
best course to pursue.</p>

<p class='c008'>He would see Morgan Anderson as soon as possible.
In the meantime Mrs. Hallard would write
to Westcott. He would probably be obliged to talk
with the lawyer for her: the mere thought set his
nerves tense; until this matter was settled his own
affairs must wait. Of this there was no question
in his mind as he directed his steps in a wide circuit
back to the town.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was nearing its outskirts when he felt a light
touch upon his arm. One of his hands was seized
in two small, clinging ones, and covered with soft,
hot kisses. He turned quickly, freeing himself
with a little shake, and looked into the upturned
face of ’Chita, the dancer.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bright stars lighted her face to a mystic,
witching glow; her eyes gleamed upon him in soft
summons as she leaned toward him, seeking again
to possess herself of his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>He drew back, ever so little, and seeing this she
stretched both arms out to him in a wide, pleading
gesture, her smiling lips parted in mute supplement
to the invitation of her gleaming eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still as a graven man he stood, regarding her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>steadily, and she came no nearer. Instead, she
shrank a little, her hands dropping to her sides, her
dark eyes fastened upon his. Gard’s stern eyes
softened and he came a step closer, brooding over
the trembling girl without touching her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Child,” he said, “haven’t you any mother?
Isn’t there anybody to take care of you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Only her heaving shoulders answered him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t cry,” Gard said, his voice full of pity.
“I—I don’t like to hear little girls cry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shivered toward him again, and reaching
quickly, her arm stole round his neck, the other
hand seeking his face. “I love you,” she whispered.
Her fingers pressed his lips, and he put her
back, firmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t,” he said sharply. “You don’t understand.
Why—you’re only a little girl. Where is
your home, child? I am going to take you there.”
She sprang back with a cry, and her anger flashed
out upon him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” she stamped one foot upon the sand. “Do
I not understand? Think you I do not? You miserable!
You have never the heart of a <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">caballero</span></i>.
You are but <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">hombre</span></i>, after all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She caught her breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gringo swine!” she hissed. “<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hombre!</span></i> It is
not the heart of a <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">caballero</span></i>!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I haven’t got the heart to crush little girls,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>answered, “if that’s what you mean. Tell me
where you live. I’m going to take you home.
You must not be out here alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He spoke now with protecting concern. The
girl’s mood had changed again, and she was sobbing
passionately.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you live in the town?” Gard persisted, and
she shook her head. Half unconsciously she was
walking beside him as he moved forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush!” she suddenly cried, checking her sobs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Across the desert came the sound of a man’s
voice, calling angrily. ’Chita put out a hand, arresting
Gard’s steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is my father,” she whispered. “He is blind;
but he has ears of the coyote. If he hears you—if
he knows—he will beat me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was but a child, now, in her terror, and Gard
reassured her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll never know,” he said. “No one will ever
know. You go back, now, like a good girl. And
remember: you must never do a silly thing like this
again. Will you promise me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She lifted a pale face toward his, in the starlight.
Her eyes were luminous, now, with new, strange
emotion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Señor,” she whispered, “it <em>is</em> the heart of a
<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">caballero</span></i>. Señor—you are good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will promise?” Gard persisted.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Again that summoning voice rang across the
desert. The girl called in Spanish that she was
coming.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I promise,” she cried, with a sobbing catch of
the breath. “<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Buenos noches</span></i>, Señor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She caught Gard’s hand again, for an instant,
resting her cheek against it, the fraction of a second.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Buenos noches</span></i>,” she whispered again, and sped
away into the soft, starry gloom.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The desert was a marvel of mauve and yellow
and rose-color, under a canopy of blue. The
sun was not too hot, and the air was vital and sustaining.
Helen Anderson, riding over the hard
plain, sniffed it joyously. She loved the smell of
the desert, that intangible, indescribable odor that
is yet so permeating: one of the fixed facts of
the region. She had missed it, hungrily, during
four years of exile from the Palo Verde.</p>

<p class='c008'>She lifted her eyes to the sapphire-blue mountains
on the horizon and laughed aloud for sheer
joy, with a sense of physical well-being, as her
vision ranged from these to nearer scenes. She
was passing a Papago’s hut, a tiny structure of
cream-colored adobe, with a dark roof of thatch.
The hut itself was hardly larger than its own big
chimney, and squatted on the yellow sand, in its
little patch of shade, was an Indian woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>She wore a skirt of dark blue stuff, and a white
reboso was wound about the upper part of her body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>and carried over her dark hair. Her dusky arms
were bare, and her brown hands patted and shaped
and smoothed a pot of red clay, soon to be
baked in the little kiln where a fire was already
glowing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen called a gay greeting to her and she looked
up, showing her white teeth in a broad smile. Then
she paused in her deft handling of the wet, red
clay, to flip a bit gently at the inquisitive nose of
Patsy, Helen’s fox terrier, who was minded to investigate
the pottery operations. Helen called the
dog and lifted her pony to a gallop. So the three
went scampering off in a wild race over the level
sand. A mile was measured before the girl drew
rein again, with a blissful sigh of pure happiness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And to think,” she told herself, with a little
feeling of unreality about it all, “that back in New
England there is snow on the ground, and fire in
the furnaces, and people who must be out of doors
are thumping their arms, to keep warm, and telling
one another what a glorious, bracing climate they
have.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She fell into a brown study and her reins lay
loose upon the pony’s neck while she went back
over the four happy years she had spent in the land
of snow. How strange it seemed that so short a
while ago the east, New England, even college itself,
had been to her mere names. Then, for four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>years, they had been such happy entities. What a
beautiful memory her whole college life was!</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now,” she mused, “it seems as if it were
all fading back into the dream again, yet I know
things are as real, back there, as they ever were,
and the real me, that Radcliffe helped make, is here
in a real place, with the realest sort of things to do.</p>

<p class='c008'>“For one thing,” she said, half aloud, “I can
keep right on making Father glad I’m home for
good, and showing him that he need not worry
about me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That thought checked a growing wistfulness in
her mood. Morgan Anderson <em>was</em> glad to have his
girl back, even though he had his well-defined
doubts as to the desert being the best place for her.
Her college years had been weary years to the
lonely man, and his happiness in the new order was
a beautiful part of Helen’s home-coming.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl could scarcely remember her mother.
There had always been Jacinta, her half-Spanish
nurse, now the household factotum, in the background
of her childish years. In the foreground
was the well-loved figure of her father, who had
been her friend and constant companion. It was
he who had taught her to read and to write, and to
do plane and solid geometry: to ride hard, to shoot
straight, and to tell the truth. Beyond these her
education, other than what old Jacinta could impart,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>had been received at the hands of one of the
cowboys on the range, a college graduate with a
love for the plains.</p>

<p class='c008'>Aunt Everett had been horrified at this arrangement.
Aunt Everett was her father’s relative, who,
on two formidable occasions, had descended upon
the rancho and undertaken to revolutionize the
household. This she did out of a sense of duty to
Helen, who, she declared, was growing up in sheer
savagery and ignorance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen was twenty years old when Aunt Everett
paid her second, and last, visit. It was then the
momentous decision was reached that the girl
should go to college. It was for the sake of his
own youthful dream of Harvard, that had never
come true, that Morgan Anderson had fixed upon
Radcliffe, and Helen’s four beautiful years had become
a fact.</p>

<p class='c008'>She sighed again, recalling those years.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They were so lovely,” she murmured, “and
they have sent me back—how is it old Marcus
Aurelius phrased it?—‘free from all discontent
with that to which thou returnest.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Free from discontent?” she cried, taking in
another deep, long breath of the buoyant air, “I
should say I am! I was never in my life so aboundingly
happy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The pony was walking slowly, and as Helen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>looked about she became aware that Patsy was not
in attendance upon them.</p>

<p class='c008'>She halted, anxiously, the dog was a recent acquisition,
given her by Sandy Larch, on her return
from college, she was training him to keep with
her. This was the first time she had really forgotten
him. She reproached herself as she rode back
over the way they had come, for letting her wits go
wool-gathering.</p>

<p class='c008'>She called the terrier, reining in from time to
time, but there was no response, and becoming at
last thoroughly alarmed, she dismounted, dropping
the pony’s reins over his head to the ground, and
started on foot to investigate among the cacti.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s found a gopher-hole somewhere,” she
said to herself, as she went whistling about among
the greasewood and cacti.</p>

<p class='c008'>She ceased to whistle, presently, vexed at Patsy’s
lack of response, and continued her search in silence
until, rounding a cactus-grown knoll, strewn
with loose stone, she suddenly halted, warned by a
familiar, burring sound that for an instant made
her heart jump.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few yards away from her was the terrier,
rigid, immovable, the hair along his back, even the
loose skin between his shoulders, stiffly erect. His
lips were drawn back from his white teeth; his ears
were pricked forward, and his whole body shuddered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>with the vibration of his low, continuous
growling.</p>

<p class='c008'>Near the dog, lying prone, his face turned toward
her, Helen saw a man, and still beyond him,
alert, motionless, save for the minute quiver of
that ominous, buzzing tail, a huge rattler was
coiled, its cold, wicked little eyes fixed upon the
dog.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must not scream; I must not faint,” the horrified
girl told herself, trying to stand steady, and
to think quick.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the dog or the snake saw her neither made
any sign. They glared, unmoving, at each other,
across the helpless man. Neither dared attack, or
retreat, and Helen knew that any move on either
her part or the man’s, would cause the snake to
strike—the dog to spring.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man lay exactly in the storm-center, when
trouble should come, and it seemed as though
neither dog nor snake could much longer maintain
the horrid statu quo. Patsy’s low growling was
dreadful to hear, and the snake’s steady rattle
brought the sweat of sheer fright to her forehead.</p>

<p class='c008'>She glanced again at the man and his gaze met
hers steadily. It was clear that he was alive to the
full peril of his position, yet there was no sign of
agitation in his face. Rather, his glance seemed
meant to reassure her. Shamed by her own fears,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Helen summoned her faculties to meet the situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had grown up in the desert. She had known
rattlesnakes before ever she went to college, and
her four years of sophistication had not crowded
out that earlier knowledge. Her brain seemed suddenly
to clear, her nerves to harden. She knew
what could be done, if she could but trust Patsy to
hold steady. She remembered Sandy Larch’s
boast, that the dog was game. Now was the time
to show it, if he was.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Steady, Patsy; steady, boy; quiet; quiet, boy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Over and over she whispered the words, oh, so
gently, that she might not startle the young dog,
and all the while she was slowly, slowly, raising
her right hand, in which was her riding-whip. She
was too thorough a plainswoman to use such a
thing on a horse, but she carried it to use in training
the terrier.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Steady, Patsy; down, boy; down!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The whip was extended in front of her, now, and
she was moving it gently from side to side. The
snake had caught sight of it, and was following it
with its eyes, swaying in unison with the whip’s
motion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Never staying the steady movement of her arm,
Helen crept forward, whispering reassurance to
the dog, until at last, still waving the whip, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>dropped to one knee and slipped her fingers under
his collar. He stopped his growling and nestled to
her with a little whimper. When she commanded
him to charge he dropped to his belly and lay perfectly
still, his eyes fixed upon the snake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you can manage to turn the thing’s head a
bit, little girl;—” it was the man who spoke, in a
low, level voice—“so he can’t notice what I’m doing,
I’ll fix him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a little nod, Helen stood up and began
moving sidewise, still swinging the whip. Thoroughly
hypnotized, the snake swayed with its
movement, those beady little eyes never leaving it.
The rattler did not see the stealthy glide of the
man’s hand, or the gleaming steel that was presently
leveled at that flat, venomous head. An instant
after there was a sharp report, and the snake
was whipping the desert in its death struggle as
Helen again caught the terrier by the collar. The
man essayed to rise, and sank back with a sharp
exclamation of pain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess I’ve hurt my foot,” he said, answering
Helen’s look of inquiry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—my horse took to pitching, and slung me
here,” he went on, sitting up. “I can’t think what
got the fellow, or me either,” he added, with a look
of chagrin. “I never thought I needed a bucking-strap;
but it seems as if I did.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>He spoke lightly, partly to hearten the girl, who
was white and shaken, after her horrid experience,
and partly to draw her attention from the victim of
his shot, now stretched on the desert.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another effort and he got to his feet; but the
first attempt to step brought him to one knee,
frowning with pain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I don’t suppose there’s a stick in sight,
that would give me any support,” he said, looking
about.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid not,” Helen answered, following
his glance; and then she remembered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can bring up my horse,” she cried. “I left
him by the mesquite when I dismounted to look for
Patsy, here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Patsy’s sure an enterprising little dog,” the
man said, smiling, “I don’t just know whether I
have to thank him for stirring up the little difficulty
a while ago, or for keeping it from being
worse before you came.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid it was he that roused the rattler,”
replied Helen, ruefully. “He is young, yet, and
has his sense to get.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man laughed. “I was a little stunned when
my horse landed me here,” he explained, shyly.
“First thing I knew I was sort of waking-up, and
that was the tableau I beheld. I didn’t do much
that was strenuous, from then on.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Helen was wondering, curiously, who the man
could be. He was evidently not a cowboy, or a
prospector, and she knew that if he were a cattleman
or a mining expert, a stranger in that part of
the country, he would naturally have been the hacienda’s
guest. Such visitors in the neighborhood
were always for her father. Perhaps he was on
his way to him, now.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Were you going to the Palo Verde?” she asked,
impulsively. “I am Helen Anderson. Father will
be sorry you have had an accident.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought you must belong there,” he said, simply,
“and I was going to tell you my name. It’s
Gard—not a very long one,” with a smile, “and I
<em>was</em> going to the Palo Verde, though your father
doesn’t know me. I wanted to see him on business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then the best thing we can do,” Helen said,
briskly, “is to get there at once. I’m going to ask
you to keep Master Patsy here, while I go for the
horse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was already speeding down the knoll, and a
moment later she returned leading Dickens, the
pony, who had stood patiently where she left him.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a time it looked as though the stranger was
not going to get into the saddle. Dickens was
restless and nervous over his awkward approaches,
and the pain in Gard’s foot was excruciating, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>after many agonized attempts he finally mounted.
He was white and faint, after the effort, but he
smiled resolutely down upon the girl while he adjusted
the stirrup he could use.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am glad you ride this way,” he said, indicating
her military tree. “I thought I’d have to sit
in one of those queer dishes ladies usually ride on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen laughed. “If I waited to have horses
gentled to the side-saddle,” she answered, “I should
never get anything to ride. It’s the only way,
here in the desert, and Father always thought it
was the safer way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was walking beside the pony, her broad-brimmed
felt hat pushed back, that she might look
up at her guest. “I used a side-saddle back east,”
she added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think this way is a lot better,” Gard replied.
He wished she would look up again. It seemed to
him that his eyes had never beheld anything more
delicious than her upturned face, with its background
of broad hat-brim.</p>

<p class='c008'>He could only glimpse it when she looked
straight ahead, as she was doing now. Her nose
had a little tilt, that made him think her always just
about to look up, and kept him in a pleasant state
of expectation. He could not see her mouth and
chin without leaning forward, and he shrank, shyly,
from doing that, but he studied the firm brown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>cheek, where just a touch of deep color came and
went, and the neat sweep of fair hair back into the
shadow of the broad hat, and he had noted when
she looked up that her eyes were gray, looking out
friendly-wise under level brows.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You were a mighty plucky little girl to tackle
that rattler,” he said, with a sudden realization of
her courage. Her short riding-habit misled him
and he did not think of her as grown up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen stiffened, resentful of what seemed like a
too familiar address. Then she recognized his mistake,
with a curious little sense of pleasure in it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was nothing,” she answered, with a lighthearted
laugh, “Sandy Larch taught me the trick.
I played that way with more than one rattler
when”—“when I was a child,” she had been about
to say, but she changed it, and added, “before I
went away to school.” “No use dragging in ‘college’”
she told herself. “He might think I was
trying to seem important.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know Sandy Larch,” Gard said. “He’s a
good man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So are you,” was the thought that flashed
through the girl’s mind as she glanced upward
again. She dismissed it instantly, with a feeling of
astonishment at herself. She was not given to
speculate in such wise on the quality of chance
acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“Sandy’s just Sandy,” she replied. “One of the
best friends I ever had. I can’t remember the time
when he wasn’t on hand looking after me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was silence for a while, till Gard spoke
again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hate to make you walk,” he apologized,
“You’ll be all tuckered out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a bit,” she declared, stoutly. “You must
be new to the desert, if you don’t know what miles
people can walk here, without getting tired.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The bronze of his face was tinged with a faint
red.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said he, “I ain’t new to the desert. Not
much I ain’t new; even—” with a mortified laugh—“if
I did let my bronco throw me. I guess,
though, I’m new to little girls,” he continued.
“Seem’s if you ought to be tired. You don’t look
so very big.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m strong, though.” Somehow, his assumption
that she was a little girl gave Helen a pleasant
sense of ease in his company. She glanced up at
him again, and was startled to see how pale he had
grown, under his tan. His forehead was knit with
pain, and his teeth were set against one lip.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish I could do something for you!” she
cried, in quick sympathy. “But we’re nearly
there; and Father’s as good as a doctor, any day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s all right,” he muttered. “I was just a fool.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>I thought I’d see if I couldn’t get down and walk;
so I tried putting that foot in the stirrup.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was a clever thing to do,” Helen scolded,
“I see you do not know how to believe people when
they say they are not tired.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She quickened her pace, that he might see how
far she was from weariness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry,” he said, humbly. “I didn’t mean
to do anything to set you running off like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>No reply. They went on again in a silence that
lasted for several moments.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ain’t you going to forgive me?” he asked,
presently.</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen considered; not what he had said however.
She was more deeply interested in deciding why his
“ain’t” was not offensive to her college-bred ears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“After all,” she thought, deliberating it, “those
things do not matter so much when people themselves
are real.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t do it again,” the voice beside her
pleaded, in an exaggeration of penitence, and she
laughed, looking up at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t think you’d be such a hard-hearted
little girl,” Gard said, reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am not,” she replied. “I am only sensible.
You should believe what people tell you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He made no reply. He was trying to decide
how old the child could be.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“I guess,” he thought, with an effort to recall
little girls he had seen—ah, how long ago it was
that he had seen any!—“she’s most likely about
twelve. She’ll be mighty pretty when she grows
up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His foot still hurt, cruelly, in consequence of his
rash experiment, but fortunately they were at the
rancho. A few moments later they had reached
the casa, where Morgan Anderson took charge
of his guest with skilful good-will. Like all cattlemen,
he was fairly expert at attending to hurts;
could set a bone, on a pinch, and it did not take
him long to discover that one of the small bones of
Gard’s foot was dislocated. With Sandy Larch’s
aid he set the matter to rights, and bandaged the
foot in a way that would have done credit to professional
skill.</p>

<p class='c008'>He would not hear of his patient’s riding back
to Sylvania that day.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a bit of it!” he cried, when Gard proposed
it. “That’s going to be one unmercifully sore foot
by to-morrow; and suppose—”</p>

<p class='c008'>He checked himself before voicing the suggestion
that another accident might possibly put the
foot badly out of commission. He had the plainsman’s
idea that a horseman should stay with his
mount; so he merely said that he wanted to keep
an eye on the foot.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“You can’t be sure one of the little bones may
not be broken,” he explained, “and anyway, we’re
mighty glad to see folks here; so I guess we’ll have
to keep you.” And Gard, more willing than at the
moment he realized, accepted the invitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Manuel Gordo who, riding in from the
upper range, saw the stranger’s horse, lathered and
excited, wandering afield, and threw a rope over
him. When he got the bronco to the Palo Verde
corrals and took off the saddle, he gave a low, comprehending
whistle. Under the blanket, well back,
but yet where a rider’s weight would press, was a
bit of cholla, the vicious fish-hook cactus of the
desert, so disposed as to cause the horse exquisite
pain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Manuel swore a rolling Mexican oath as the
thing caught his fingers, and stamped it into the
desert before giving attention to the bronco’s back.
This, later, he showed to Sandy Larch, with a vivid
explanation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The blame cowards!” the foreman commented.
“So they thought they’d git ’im that way, did they?
It seemed mighty queer to me that he couldn’t sit
anything four-legged he was likely to git in the
ord’nary run, in Sylvania; but that pinto must ’a’
raged considerable with that on its back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who you think do-a that?” Manuel asked, and
the foreman told him of the scene in the Happy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Family Saloon. “Some o’ that gang’s been tryin’
to get even,” he finished, and Manuel growled assent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I see that señor before to-day,” he ventured,
hesitating, “He one good man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where ’d you ever meet up with ’im?” demanded
Sandy. “Where ’d he come from?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quién sabe?” Manuel’s shoulders lifted. “It is
at Sylvania I see heem,” he added, non-committally,
and understanding dawned upon the foreman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You did, eh?” he laughed, “An’ he got after
you an’ made you quit that spree you was headed
on, I bet. That what you come home so quick for?
How’d he round you up?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Mexican grinned, shamefacedly, and Sandy
laughed again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s sure a sin-buster,” he commented, admiringly,
“But he done you a good turn that time,
Manuel. The <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">patron</span></i>’d given me orders to everlastingly
fire you next time you showed up after a
spree, an’ I’d ’a’ sure done it if you hadn’t ’a’
been on hand that mornin’ same ’s usual!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Manuel was busy smearing axle-grease on the
bronco’s back, to keep the flies from its hurts.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The señor, he good man all right,” he said, not
turning around, and Sandy Larch, being shrewd,
walked away without further comment.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>As Morgan Anderson had predicted, the condition
of Gard’s foot next day was such as to
make him a captive. The cattleman, surveying it
after Jacinta had given the patient his breakfast,
prescribed rest, and forbade any thought of leaving
the rancho inside of a week.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You say you came to see me on business,” he
said, as he stood looking down upon Gard where
he lay in bed in a big, low-ceiled room of the casa,
“Well, I’m off to the upper range to-day, to
pick out some work-cattle. I shall not be able to
talk business till night; so that settles to-day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re mighty good,” was Gard’s reply, “but
that business o’ mine is only to ask you a question
that you can answer in half a minute. You mustn’t
think it’s some matter of consequence—to anybody
but me, that is,” he added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right; so much the better. It’ll keep, and
we can keep you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Morgan Anderson had taken a liking to his unexpected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>guest, and made him welcome with true
western hospitality. It was long since Gard had
talked with a man of his stamp, and the mere
sound of Anderson’s pleasant, easy voice was a joy
to him. It was good just to lie there and listen; at
the same time, he was concerned about his foot.
He wanted to be up and about Kate Hallard’s business.
He had not calculated that the delivery of
the deed which he had found in Arnold’s coat-pocket
two years before, would involve him as it
had done.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had come back to civilization with a strong
purpose. He meant to make every effort to reinstate
himself in the eyes of the law, and he realized
that he must do all that he could before some
chance recognition should work to hinder his efforts.
Nevertheless, he told himself, the claim of
this woman came first. Kate Hallard had no one
to fend for her, and the responsibility, in this particular
matter, had been laid on him, Gabriel Gard.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later in the forenoon, when Anderson had ridden
away with his men, Wing Chang, the Chinese
cook, acting upon the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">patron’s</span></i> instructions, established
Gard in a long steamer-chair, under the
cottonwoods beside the casa. Hither, when he
was settled, came Helen, bearing a little tray on
which were biscuits and a grape-fruit. Gard
smiled as he saw her coming around a corner of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>casa, and answered her greeting with a cheery
“good-morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wondered where you’d got to,” he began, and
stopped, suddenly, the quick color rushing to his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now I just beg your pardon, Miss,” he stammered,
in piteous confusion, “I mistook—I thought—I
thought you were your little sister.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am,” laughed Helen, putting the tray on a
chair by his side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no: you mustn’t move your foot”—for
Gard was struggling forward in his steamer-chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you do,” she threatened, “I shall have to
scold you harder than I did yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He sank back, a look in his face of mingled chagrin
and wonder. Helen was arrayed in white,
the simplest sort of a shirt-waist suit, with a touch
of brown at neck and belt and shoes; but to his
bewildered senses she was a radiant vision of unguessed
daintiness and beauty. There was something
incredible, to him, in the idea of this unearthly
being offering him food. He glanced from
her to the tray, and back again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know what that is,” he said, indicating
the grape-fruit, “and I ain’t sure I know what you
are. I thought yesterday you were a little girl,
and now you seem like a young lady; and I don’t
seem right sure you won’t turn into a fairy in a
minute, and run away.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“Oh, Oh!” Helen cried, “What three-fold flattery!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then it was her turn to experience a shock; for,
as she stood looking down upon him, it suddenly
became apparent to her that this man was young.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had thought nothing about the matter, in
the excitement of yesterday’s encounter, and when
she had walked beside him, seeing his bearded face
in her brief, upward glances, she had taken it for
granted that he was middle-aged, at least. There
was something disconcerting about the unexpected
revelation of youth in those eager brown eyes, in
the clear olive of the face above the strong, short
beard, and in the firm curve of red lips just visible
under the moustache. She could think of no further
retort to his pretty speech, and busied herself
with showing him how to eat the grape-fruit, wondering,
vaguely, where he could have been, in the
desert, not to have encountered <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">pomelos</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>“These are from over the border,” she explained.
“One of the boys smuggled them in last week;
think how wicked we are! But by New Year’s we
shall have some of our very own.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re mighty good,” Gard said, with no idea
of what the fruit tasted like. He was still wrestling
with the awesome fact that Helen had prepared it,
and was teaching him to eat it. He took more
sugar when she told him to, though years of abstinence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>from sugar had blunted his taste for it, and
he shook his head with very proper commiseration
when she told him of the way eastern folk spoil the
fruit in preparing it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never was back there,” he said, “I was raised
on the prairie; but this is good enough for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked beyond the fringe of cottonwoods,
out across the plain, quivering in the mid-forenoon
heat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you like it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I love it! It’s so big, and beautiful, in spite of
its dreadfulness; it’s so <em>positive</em>!” Helen was sitting
on the ground, her hands in her lap, her eyes
turned toward the far mountains. Gard considered
her words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Positive:” he repeated, thoughtfully, “Yes: it’s
sure that. There ain’t any half-way place,” he
added, drawing a deep breath. “A man, he gets
big, or he gets little, living in it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” cried she; “you must have been a long
time in the desert to find that out!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She went on, with youthful, unconscious arrogance:
“I’ve lived here all my life; but I never
realized that until after I came back from college
this last time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you been here long?” she added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I haven’t been ’round the level much,” Gard
answered, and after a pause he added:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“I’ve been in the mountains most of the time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you must have been prospecting: I hope
you struck pay dirt?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good! So you <em>are</em> a mining-man—I wondered.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She had wondered about him. Gard turned the
thought over in his mind, the while he told her
something of his discovery in the mountains. It
seemed a marvelous thing that she should have
thought of him at all. Almost unconsciously he
began telling her of finding his claim; of working
it; and of Jinny.</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen listened with rapt interest. She knew that
men did go off into the mountains as she supposed
Gard must have done. She had talked with prospectors,
in her lifetime, but never with one like
this.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you will be wonderfully rich when
you begin working your claim in earnest,” she said,
at last, slowly, “Shall you like that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think so. There are some things I want a
good deal”—Ah, how much he wanted them: the
right to freedom; the right to hold up his head
among men. Gard’s desire for this was increasing
with every moment that he sat talking to this fair,
unconscious girl. As he looked at her, sitting before
him on the sparse grass, it came home to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>with fearful force that it would be hard to have
friends if his past life must always be a secret from
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose there are,” Helen was saying, half
wistfully, “Money brings so many opportunities to
a man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not unless he’s a real man to start with,” replied
Gard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s a lot to be thought about,” he went on.
“I used to think that to give a man plenty to eat,
and wear, and good things round him; nice, beautiful
things such as we read about—and I guess
that you’ve always seen,” he explained,—“would
help make a better man of him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe it’s altogether so,” he went on,
following a train of thought that he had often
mulled over, in the glade, “All the good things that
you can put a man into won’t make any better man
of him, if when he didn’t have ’em he wasn’t
trying to make a better man of himself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen pondered his saying in some surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never thought of it that way before,” she said,
at last, “but it seems as if it ought to be true.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess it’s true enough,” Gard frowned a little,
deep in thought. “Jinny and I, we used to figure
out ’twas, when we talked things over.” He
smiled into his companion’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When I think, sometimes, of what men’ll do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>for money, though,” continued he, “I ’most feel ’s
if I didn’t want any of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it seems cleaner money, somehow,” Helen
interrupted, “it’s different when a man digs it out
of the earth. He doesn’t rob, or defraud anybody,
then; and think of all it can do!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.” There was a slow twinkle in Gard’s eyes
as he spoke. “There’s solid satisfaction to me in
thinking that one o’ these days, if I want to, I can
get Jinny a solid gold collar.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They laughed together over this bit of foolishness,
feeling, suddenly, that they were very good
friends. It was almost with a little sense of something
unwelcome that Helen, looking across the
level plain, saw a horseman in the distance, coming
toward the rancho-gate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some one is coming,” she said, studying the
approaching figure. “I wonder who it can be;
Daddy isn’t expecting anyone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard turned his head and they watched together.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t one of the men,” commented Helen.
“He looks cityfied, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was no careless cowboy figure that they
watched. Whoever it was rode compactly, elbows
down, and the horse was not running, but coming
at an easy ’lope.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why!” the girl exclaimed, after a moment or
two, “I believe it’s Mr. Westcott!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>The name set Gard’s heart pounding, but he kept
his quiet pose in the steamer-chair, and only the
faintest flutter of distended nostrils betrayed the
emotion that was surging within him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had no real fear that Westcott might recognize
him. The lawyer, as it happened, had seen
him but twice; once at Phoenix, just after his
arrest, and again on the occasion of that memorable
visit to Blue Gulch. Nevertheless, Gard was
thankful that he was warned of the new-comer’s
approach.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you know him?” Helen asked, still watching
the rider, and Gard answered, promptly enough,
that he had heard of him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s stopping at the corrals,” said Helen, presently.
“I hope there’s some one there to take his
horse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She started off, with a backward glance and a
smile for her invalid, and presently Gard saw her
going toward the corrals, followed by Wing Chang.
She walked with a light, springing step that seemed
to him must be peculiar to her alone. He had seen
girls, back in Iowa, but they had not walked like
that.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There ain’t anybody like her,” he said, half
aloud, replying to his own thought. Then he remembered
that happy glance, and smile, and a
shiver of pain ran through him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“Heaven help me,” he muttered, “She wouldn’t
have looked like that if she’d known.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen, in the meantime, was greeting Westcott,
who walked up to the casa with her, leaving
his horse for Chang to unsaddle and turn in. He
had come up to Sylvania to see a man, he explained,
and when he got where the man was, why
the man was not there. He showed his handsome,
even teeth in a merry smile at his own jest, and
somehow managed to convey to Helen the idea that
the man “wasn’t there” for the reason that he was
afraid to meet him, Ashley Westcott.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s just a game of bluff some smart Aleck is
trying to play on me,” he added, with pleasant
carelessness; “It isn’t of much importance, except as
it gives me the excuse I’m always glad of, to ride
out here. I shall have to wait over, a day or two, to
give the fellow a chance to make good, I dare say.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His eyes narrowed when he was introduced to
Gard. Kate Hallard had written to him, three days
before, and the letter had brought him to Sylvania
in a hurry. He had seen Mrs. Hallard and, therefore,
Gard’s name had significance for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He seated himself in the chair from which Jacinta
had long since removed the tray, and made a
casual inquiry about Gard’s hurt. Gard explained
it briefly, giving, to Helen’s immense relief, none
of the details.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“I was in Sylvania this morning,” Westcott remarked,
taking the glass of ice and the bottle of
ginger ale that Jacinta brought him. “Came up
from Tucson, and got that brute of a stage at
Bonesta.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It <em>is</em> a horrid ride,” Helen commented.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard said nothing, and Westcott and Helen
chatted indifferently for a few moments of matters
common enough, the news and talk of the territory,
yet as new to Gard, in large measure, as though he
had been a foreigner. The lawyer turned to him
again, irritated by his silent scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I saw your friend Mrs. Hallard in Sylvania,”
he said, “She was a good deal worried to know
what had become of you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard’s eyes flashed, but his reply was given in a
low, even tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was mighty kind of her,” he said, “I calculated
to be on hand—we reckoned you’d be coming
soon. When you go back you can ease her mind,
and let her know I’m all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen looked puzzled. She was not familiar
with Sylvania, although it was the post office town
of the rancho, but she knew, in a vague way, who
Mrs. Hallard was. It would have been difficult not
to know, when there were but half a dozen white
women within a radius of fifty miles. She could not
think of her, however, as a friend of this new acquaintance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>She had seen Mrs. Hallard once, and
Westcott’s apparently chance remark had exactly
the effect he had calculated. It troubled her, and
disturbed the atmosphere of friendliness which he
had dimly felt between the girl and Gard, when he
saw them together.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It seems curious to find Mr. Gard here,” the
lawyer went on, addressing Helen. “He is just the
man I came to Sylvania to see. You can bank on it
I did not expect to meet him when I rode this way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He overshot his mark, that time, going too far
in his anxiety to produce an impression unfavorable
to Gard. Helen’s hospitality was touched, and
her sympathy enlisted for her guest. Whatever
his friendship for Mrs. Hallard, of whom she
really knew nothing definite, she did not believe
that the man who sat there regarding them both
with serene eyes, would ever be afraid to meet Ashley
Westcott.</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked from one to the other, and Gard
smiled as he answered the lawyer’s remark, speaking
to her rather than to the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” he said, “I’m the man. I told Mrs. Hallard,”
he added, glancing at Westcott, “to tell you
to see me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall, all right,” the lawyer replied, pointedly,
and turned to ask Helen some question about
her father. She was glad of the diversion, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>went into detail about his errand to the upper
range.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re going to have an orchard,” she explained,
“Father had some trees put in three or
four years ago; I believe he must have sat and held
their heads all the while I was away, and watered
them with a teaspoon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The others joined in her laugh at the vision conjured
up of Morgan Anderson playing nurse to
desert trees.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They are only a few grape-fruit, and a date
palm or two,” Helen went on, “but they have kindled
his ambition, and now he is planning for
oranges, and apricots.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has he got the trees yet?” Gard asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mercy, no! Our needs are still more elemental
than that. He has gone after some cattle to ‘gentle’
for plowing. Can’t you just see those wild-eyed
long-horns figuring in pastoral idyls on the plain?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott grinned, but before either man could
comment Wing Chang appeared from the direction
of the adobe structure that served him for kitchen,
and beckoned Helen to a domestic conference.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wing Chang’s official beck is equal to a royal
summons,” she said, lightly, “so I shall have to be
excused for a season.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When she had departed the two men regarded
each other for a little space. Westcott took out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>paper and tobacco, offering them to Gard. The
latter declined them and the lawyer began rolling
himself a cigarette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I take it you’re an attorney, Mr. Gard?” he
began, in a tone of careless query, as he struck a
match.</p>

<p class='c008'>At Gard’s negative he held the little taper alight
in his finger for an instant, while he stared in surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh,” he said, recovering himself quickly, and
lighting his cigarette, “I thought you must be. I
rather figured,”—with a laugh which he meant to
be irritating, “that you were a young attorney, or
a new-comer in the territory, and trying to scare
up business.” He puffed a cloud of smoke into the
air and regarded his companion through it, with
veiled eyes. “’Twas rather natural, don’t you
think?” he persisted, with a sneer, “considering the
nature of the little game up at Sylvania?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Still Gard did not speak. He had put his well
foot to the ground, and curled the other leg up
that he might lean forward, and he sat regarding
Westcott with quiet attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you know, anyway,” the latter finally
said, with a very good assumption of contempt,
“Anybody with a headpiece might, whether he’s a
lawyer or not, that neither my client nor I need
feel obliged to pay any attention to the matter.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Gard seemed to turn the remark over in his mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then what made you come up here?” he finally
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s easy,” Westcott answered, scornfully.
“I wanted to see who was trying to make a fool of
poor Kate Hallard. I don’t wish her any harm,
and I wanted to put her wise that she’s being used
by some sharper, in a queer game.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess you’ll think better o’ that before we
get through, Mr. Westcott,” Gard said, with deliberation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not much I won’t.” Westcott was admiring
the rings he had blown into the air. “Fact is, my
friend,” he went on, with an air of easy confidence,
“the more I think of your little scheme the less I
think of it. In the first place, it won’t work. My
client is in possession. That’s nine points, you
know. By way of a tenth point, he has a quit
claim from Mrs. Hallard—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s one item,” Gard interrupted, softly,
“that I guess you won’t care to dwell on, when the
matter comes to be pushed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pushed!” Westcott ignored the first part of the
speech. “I tell you, man,” he cried, “you’ve got
nothing that can <em>be</em> pushed! That deed you an’
Kate Hallard pretend to have found hasn’t a leg
to stand on. You’d better be careful you don’t get
into trouble with it.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“I’m going to, Mr. Westcott,” the slow, calm
tone made the lawyer feel uneasy, he could not
have told why.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If it will save you any trouble, my friend,” he
sneered, at the same time keeping a close watch on
the other’s face, “I’ll tell you that I saw some time
ago, in a Chicago paper, that Jared Oliphant is out
of commission—softening of the brain. I suppose
you weren’t banking any on him, though?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re banking on facts,” was Gard’s reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And Sawyer’s skipped the country.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who’s Sawyer?” Gard’s question came quick
and sharp, nailing Westcott’s blunder fast. The
lawyer looked blank for an instant, then recovered
himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why Kate Hallard seemed to think you were
going to get some help through him,” he lied; “but
I know Sawyer. You can’t do it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must have known him,” Gard said, “if you
know he witnessed that deed; for Kate Hallard
never told you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott stared out at the desert. He was playing
a desperate game, and he knew it. He would
have given much to understand the inscrutable man
who sat opposite him. He did not feel that he did
understand him, fully; nevertheless, he had his own
theories of the stuff men are made of, and presently
he leaned forward.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>“Look here, Gard,” he said, “This is mighty
poor business for a man like you to be in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He spoke rapidly; for Miss Anderson had just
appeared at the door of the adobe kitchen, still talking
to Wing Chang.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know what you expect to make by it,”
Westcott went on; “but I don’t want Kate Hallard
to get into any trouble. She can’t establish that
deed. It’s no more use to her than so much blank
paper. But I’ve got certain things in view. I’m
going into politics in this territory, and there are
reasons why I don’t want a thing like this coming
up. You know how things get garbled—” He hesitated,
and then went on, with a glance in the direction
of the girl, who was now approaching.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Between ourselves,” he said, rapidly, “what’s
the reason you and I can’t do business together?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He regarded his companion narrowly. Helen
had stopped, near the casa, and was scanning the
desert from under her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you say?” Westcott all but whispered.
Gard looked at him a full moment before he spoke:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess we couldn’t do business together,” he
said, slowly, “But I guess we shan’t need to, Mr.
Westcott; because you’re going to fix this matter
up right. You’re going to give Mrs. Hallard back
the property you stole from her, or else you’re
going to pay her the full value.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“Or else?”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a battle of eyes between the two men.
Westcott’s flinched, finally, and sought the horizon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There ain’t any other ‘or else,’” Gard said, at
last. “It’s going the way I stated.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott had arisen, sneering, but before he
could speak again Helen’s voice broke in upon
them:</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re coming!” she cried, joining her guests.
“You’d think they had a whole drove of cattle,
from the noise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A cloud of white dust far on the desert had resolved
itself into a flurry of men, horses and cattle,
coming in on a run. There was a thunder of hoofs,
and a chorus of yells, and presently the “gentle”
work-cattle were being herded into one of the
corrals.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the horsemen separated himself from the
group and rode on to the casa. This was Morgan
Anderson, and he shouted greeting to Westcott
as he swung from the saddle. He came into the
shade of the cottonwoods firing a volley of genial
questions, and giving bits of detail about the morning’s
work, until Helen reminded him that it was
close upon dinner-time. That meal was taken at
noon, at the Palo Verde, so Anderson excused himself
to clean up. He was dusty and begrimed from
the hot day’s work. He carried Westcott off as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>well, to remove the traces of his own long ride, and
as Helen had already gone into the house, on some
domestic errand, Gard was left alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>The temporary solitude was welcome, and he lay
back in the long chair half dizzied by the thoughts
and memories that besieged his brain. Uppermost,
for the instant, was an intense, grateful sense of
relief. Westcott had so plainly not recognized him
that he might consider one source of immediate
danger to himself removed. He would probably
be able to carry this business through with no other
difficulties than lay in the matter itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>There would be plenty of these. Westcott would
see to that. He was evidently fully aware of the
position he was in, and would let no scruples stand
in the way of protecting himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll do just about anything—” Gard spoke
half aloud, then checked himself, recalling that
this was not the solitude of the glade.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll make a big fight,” he thought, “both to
keep the property and to escape being punished.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>Punished!</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>The word came home to him with stunning
force. The punishment for this crime, if Kate
Hallard saw fit to press the matter, was jail!</p>

<p class='c008'>And Kate Hallard would probably do what he
advised.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sudden fierce exultation leaped into the man’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>heart. Beneath his quiet he had been deeply stirred
by the encounter with Westcott.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>I wonder how he would like being in jail?</em>” he
thought, grimly, and brought himself sternly into
line again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There ain’t any right of way for me there. I
must stop that,” he whispered, the knuckles of his
big hands white as wool under the strain of clasping
his chair-arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next instant he sat upright, staring out
across the hot sand, but seeing only the vision of
Helen’s dainty maiden loveliness. The thought of
his heart sent the blood from his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve settled my account with Ashley Westcott,”
he muttered, “God knows I’ve settled <em>my</em> account;
but if that is what he’s aiming to do—”</p>

<p class='c008'>He shivered, sinking back into his chair. Wing
Chang was approaching with a tray of food.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If that is what it is,” Gard finished to himself,
turning to greet the Chinaman, “Then I guess Mr.
Ashley Westcott and I will have to open a new account;
and he wants to look out.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER V</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>To Westcott’s secret delight Morgan Anderson,
going after dinner to see that his other guest
had been properly served, found Gard fast asleep
in the long chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll let him have his siesta out,” said his host.
“I don’t suppose he got any too much sleep last
night, with that foot. Helen, you and I can take
Westcott to see the new corrals.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This arrangement was entirely to Westcott’s
pleasure. He knew, from past experience, that the
cattleman would promptly become interested in
some problem of the range, and leave his entertainment
to Helen.</p>

<p class='c008'>He strolled by her side as they made their way
to the corrals, and put from his mind the uneasy
thoughts that kept intruding. In spite of his defiance,
he was horribly afraid of what Gard and
Mrs. Hallard might be able to do. He did not
know how they would move to establish the deed,
but he was in a position that would make publicity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>awkward. How he wished he knew where the
paper had been found! To get any help from Oliphant
he believed was out of the question, and he,
himself, had been unable to find Sawyer. He was
sure that Gard could not get hold of him; and if he
should, he knew how to fix the fellow. He had one
more card up his sleeve, and would play it, if Sawyer
appeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>But after this! He stole a glance at the girl
walking beside him. He wanted money; he wanted
power; he wanted position—to offer her. He was
almost where he just now aspired to be on the political
ladder. He had not tried for small things;
he was after the District Attorneyship, and it was
coming his way, now. Another year, and then,&#160;...
by Heaven! Everything was going to be
straight! There should be nothing that those clear
gray eyes might not see!</p>

<p class='c008'>But this matter must not come out! He would
see Mrs. Hallard in the town while Gard was laid
up. His career should not be ruined, just as he was
getting where he could hold up his head and choose
the straight path. He was weary in his soul of the
other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen looked up with a glance of inquiry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They seem to be long, long thoughts,” she said,
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“They are,” was the quick response. “I was
thinking of my ambitions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If it were so, it were a grievous fault,” she
quoted, gaily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think so!” He threw out his chest and
looked down at her from his full height. “A man’s
bound to have ambitions of some sort,” he said,
“They’re a measure of himself. Of course I have
mine. I want the things I want when I can get
them; but I want them, nevertheless, and I mean to
have them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Such as a gold collar for your donkey?” Helen
asked, enigmatically.</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott looked puzzled, but she did not explain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not exactly that,” he finally said, “If my
donkey won’t go without a gold collar I’m sorry
for him; because he’s going just the same. He’s
got to carry me, ‘For the good of the order.’ This
Territory needs men, Miss Anderson: and I mean
to be one of the men that it needs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! That is good!” Helen’s sympathetic response
quickened what Westcott, if he had characterized
it, would have called his good impulse.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s a lot that needs straightening out
within our lines,” he said, “And I want the chance
to help in the work. At any rate, it’s not an ignoble
ambition.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>“Indeed it is not.” Helen had never before seen
Westcott in this mood, and she rather reproached
herself that she did not feel a keener response.
She felt that she had not done him justice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am glad you think about those things,” she
told him. “Father talks to me, sometimes, and I
know that he is often troubled. It seems as if every
man is solely for himself. We need those who can
see wrong in high places, as well as low; and who
have courage to combat it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott felt a pang of wretchedness as he answered
her frank glance. He realized that she
would despise him if she knew some of the things
that he had done, and he winced in the realization.
But he meant to leave all that behind. He would
do something for Mrs. Hallard, and once he had
won this splendid girl he would walk the open way.
Heavens! What could a man not do, with such a
helpmate!</p>

<p class='c008'>A sudden sense of his own unworthiness brought
unwonted humility into his heart. Ashley Westcott
had never before, in his grown-up life, been so
near to feeling a noble impulse.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Anderson,” he said, “I’m afraid I should
never come up to any ideal of yours; but I aim to
do as near right as I know how.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They were at the corrals now, where the cattleman,
who had drawn ahead, was already talking to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Sandy Larch about some young horses that were
to be got ready for shipment east, before spring.
Polo ponies from the Palo Verde enjoyed a good
market back in “The States.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In one of the corrals the future work-cattle were
penned, half a dozen head, lean, leggy brutes, wild-eyed
and ugly. They kept together, moving restlessly
about in a bunch, watching the visitors sullenly,
and occasionally lunging at one another with
wide, wicked horns.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re beauts, for fair,” Sandy Larch remarked,
“Only they can’t seem to make up their
minds to look it in public. They’re that kind o’
modest vi’lets.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Twon’t be exactly a Sunday school picnic to
break them in,” Westcott remarked, looking them
over.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure it will,” said Sandy, impressively. “Why
them cows will be door-yard pets, once they’re
handled. Their bad looks is just a yearning for
appreciation. That one, now—”</p>

<p class='c008'>He tossed a little clod into the blazed face of one
huge steer that had moved a little apart from the
others. It was a vicious-looking brute, and stood
lowing, sullenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That there blaze-faced cow’ll be coaxing fer sugar
out’n your hand in a week’s time, Miss Helen,”
Sandy declared. “Can’t you see it in his eye?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Helen could not see it, and said so, frankly. A
cowboy, minded to reach the further corral, where
the young horses were, sprang down into the enclosure
with the cattle, and started across.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an instant the big red steer came charging
upon him, with mischief in his eye. The cowboy
saw the brute, and dodging, made a rapid sprint
for the nearest fence, clambering over it amid the
derisive shouts of the spectators. The man’s sudden
scramble had brought him within a few feet of
Westcott who, turning to look at him, made a gesture
of recognition.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hullo, Broome!” he said: “I didn’t know you
were down here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks like I was on the spot,” the fellow answered,
“I bin holdin’ it down fer about a week.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I heard you went prospecting,” Westcott continued,
and Broome swore, under his breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Came mighty near cashin’ in that trip,” he
growled, and then he drew nearer, with a quick
glance at the others, who were walking on toward
the horse corral.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, Mr. Westcott,” he muttered, “Have you
seen that there feller up ’t the casa? Him with
the hair <em>mat</em>tress on his face?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you mean Gard?” Westcott asked in amazement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yep: that’s his name. Damn him an’ it! I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>met up with him on my ‘tower.’ He’s some buffalo
now; but he was haired up like a bug-house
billy-goat then. But say, Mr. Westcott: he’d
struck it rich; got a streak o’ color that fair stunk
o’ gold, back in the mountains. I want to tell you
’bout it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott looked after his companions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t stop to hear it now, Broome,” he said.
“Shall you be round when I leave here? I’ll talk
to you then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m goin’ to be workin’ with the horses all the
afternoon,” Broome answered. “We’re goin’ to
be bustin’ ’em out, an’ that’s one o’ my jobs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He added the last with a good deal of pride, and
Westcott nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll see you, then,” he said, moving off.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you know Broome?” Mr. Anderson asked,
when Westcott overtook the others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pretty well”; was the reply. “I knew him up
north. He was cow-punch for a friend of mine,
and I used to be up there a good deal. He’s a
good hand with horses.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So he claims,” Anderson said. “He blew in
the other day, bragging that he’s a first-class
bronco-buster. We’re pretty short, so Sandy took
him on. I don’t think much of his looks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he’s all right.” Westcott spoke carelessly.
“A good many singed cats look worse.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Sandy Larch had gone up to the cook’s quarters on
an errand, and passing the casa found Gard awake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hullo, Mr. Larch,” the latter called, espying
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>Mister</em> Larch?” Sandy made a pretense of
looking for the person addressed. “Where ’d you
keep ’im?” he asked, with elaborate solicitude.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep who?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>Mister</em> Larch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They ain’t no such party hereabouts,” he went
on before Gard could reply. “Leastwise <em>you</em> don’t
know ’im. Dudes, an’ Chinks, they nominates me
<em>Mister</em> Larch; because the first don’t know no
better, an’ the others they has to, er git busted good
an’ plenty. But to my friends I’m Sandy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe it!” laughed Gard. “I guess your
friends find you <em>all</em> sand, when they need the article.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sandy looked at him with frank admiration.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say: now you’re shouting,” he cried. “I like
that there. Speakin’ o’ bouquets, you couldn’t ’a’
handed me a prettier one if you’d set still to think
it up fer a week.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Glad you like it,” replied Gard. “I meant it to
be liked.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Like it? Say! you just combed my hair nice,
didn’t you? An’ when you need someone to weigh
out sand you just <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">buscar</span></i> me, Mr. Gard.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“No you don’t; you drop that!” Gard looked
stern.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Drop what?” demanded Sandy, startled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your <em>Mister</em> Gard. That rule of yours has got
to work both ways, and <em>my</em> name is Gabriel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a twinkle in the brown eyes; but
Gard’s tone was inflexible.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gabriel!” gasped Sandy. “Lord! How do you
git off at it? Gabriel”; he repeated, “Shoot me if
I can git a rope over that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Glory be!” A gleam of fun crossed his anxious
face. “That name’s too long for every day,”
he said, “But I can fix it: I’ll call you Angel, if
you like. Angel Gabriel. That’s great! That’s
how we’ll fix it. Angel on week-days; Gabriel on
Sundays, an’ Angel Gabriel on Fourth o’ Julys, an’
when I’m drunk. Angel Gabriel’s a first rate
name fer a amachoor sin-buster to sport.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll drop that, too.” Gard seized one of
the cushions Helen had supplied his chair with, and
hurled it at the cow-puncher. “Don’t you go making
fun of my name when I’m down,” he cried.
“Sandy, you’ve got to call me Gard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He held out his hand and Sandy grasped it,
cordially.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I like you, Gard,” said he, with quick seriousness.
“We’re partners for fair if you say so. If
you need friends, as I expressed a while back,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>you’ll know where to look fer one of ’em; you
won’t fergit it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never,” Gard said, heartily, and Sandy drew
back. The others were coming up from the corrals.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never was hard on any man unless I thought
he needed it, Gard,” remarked Sandy, looking toward
them. “But that there Westcott—well I’ll
be damned if I kin ‘go’ him. He can rope ’n hogtie
the law, ’n brand it ten different ways while
you’re lookin’ one; but I bet he ain’t always goin’
to git away on time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, Gard: he’s mighty sleek to look at, an’
women like sech; but if I thought he was likely to
git a rope over our pretty filly there—damned if I
wouldn’t wanter let a little daylight through ’im.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Sandy, too, had his fears. Gard’s eyes narrowed
as he surveyed the approaching group.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shucks, Sandy!” he exclaimed. “You want to
keep away from the loco patches, man. He
couldn’t do it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The thought of Helen’s frank, pure eyes put
unnecessary emphasis into his speech; but Sandy
was pleased.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good talk!” he cried, with a long breath of relief.
“Guess I’m some of an old fool; but I’ve
seen the little gal grow up from that high,” measuring
an incredibly short distance above the desert,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“An’ you put in a pin where I tell you, Gard: that
there Westcott’s a tarantula an’ a side-winder all
into one; an’ some day you’ll know it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess that’s no lie, Sandy.” Gard’s face was
pale, and his eyes wore a strange look. He spoke
very low; for the others were coming within earshot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guess I’ll mosey along,” the foreman said.
“I come a driftin’ up here after some hog-grease,
an’ I’ll have to <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">buscar</span></i> Chang fer’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He walked off in the direction of the kitchen as
the others began talking to Gard. Half an hour
afterwards Anderson was waving <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">adios</span></i> to Westcott,
from the great rancho gateway.</p>

<p class='c008'>The attorney rode out on the desert, glorious in
the afternoon light, and taking a wide sweep
turned back by way of the corrals. A cow-puncher
who had been squatting against one of the fences,
waiting, got up as he came in sight, and shuffled
out to meet him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did you want of me, Broome?” Westcott
asked at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>Broome lounged up against the fence, his hands
in his pockets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I been playin’ in a hell o’ luck lately, Mr. Westcott,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott made a move as if to ride on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If it’s nothing but a hard luck story,” he began.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“No, no. It ain’t.” Broome laid a restraining
hand on the pony’s mane.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want ter know who that feller is up yonder.”
He jerked his head toward the casa, at the same
time characterizing Gard after a manner entirely
to his own mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know him from a hole in the post,”
Westcott said, with great apparent candor. “What
makes him get on <em>your</em> nerves so?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He give me the double cross an’ the grand
throw-down, sure, all in the same shuffle,” Broome
said, with a snarl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where was that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sommers in the mountains. I was lost in the
desert; pretty near cashed in, an’ I met up with this
feller. He took me inter camp, hell of a outfit.
Everything made outer nothing, same ’s a Papago
where they ain’t no settlement handy. He was
eatin’ tree beans, an’ shootin’ game with a bowarrer,
an’ he had all sorts o’ scare-crow Bible verses
wrote up round like a Sunday school. Sufferin’
snakes! You never see the beat of it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know as I ever want to,” Westcott said,
impatiently. “Drive on, Broome.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m a drivin’. Gimme time. Say, Mr. Westcott:
the cuss ’d struck it rich up there, like I told
you. Got a vein o’ yeller laid open like a roarin’
buttercup.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>“Got it staked and located, too, I suppose,” the
lawyer said, with a sneer. “Bite it off, Broome:
what are you driving at?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tell you I <em>am</em> bitin’ it off,” was the sullen rejoinder.
“I tell you there’s gold to burn up there.
It’s the damndest, likeliest place you ever see.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why didn’t you prospect a little too?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Prospect!” Broome swore, savagely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That there locoed buffalo he tried to kill me,
when he found I’d discovered the vein. He’d took
me up the trail clean dopy, an’ he brought me down
blindfold, with my hands tied, on the back of a
damned little she-ass; so I wouldn’t know how to
git back there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh,” Westcott jeered. “And what you want of
me is to take you by the little hand and lead you
back there and let you dig?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No I don’t neither! I got a good scheme, an’
I want ter let you in on it. You done a lot fer me,
once, Mr. Westcott.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet I did,” was Westcott’s response. “You
owe me the price of your own neck, whatever that
may be worth to you; but I can’t see where you’re
going to pay it out of this scheme.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d a done it all right by now if that feller
hadn’t nearly killed me,” Broome said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why didn’t he quite kill you if he wanted to?”
asked Westcott, incredulously.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“Hell! <em>I</em> dunno,” was the frank admission; “I’d
a done him good an’ plenty, you bet; but he didn’t,
an’ here I am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott sat his horse, waiting, with an elaborate
assumption of patience.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here’s what I’m thinkin’ of,” began Broome,
talking fast. “I’m busted, Mr. Westcott: I ain’t
got even a bronc o’ my own; but if I c’d git anybody
to grub-stake me, I’d go up the railroad to
where Gard left that burro—I know the place all
right—an’ I’d git ’er; I’d know ’er by a big scar
on one shoulder. An’ you bet the hash once she
was out on the desert she’d strike fer that there
camp in the mountains. She’s that kind. He
tamed her out o’ the wild, he said, an’ she never
knowed no other place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then what would you do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Be Johnnie on the spot,” replied Broome. “Git
in an’ dig. In the same place, mebby.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you mean jump it?” The question was
put in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ain’t sayin’ what I mean; but I mean all ’t ’s
necessary to git back the rights that feller done
me out of.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott considered, looking thoughtfully out
on the desert.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s risky,” was his comment, at length.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ain’t askin’ <em>you</em> to risk it,” growled the other.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>“All I want o’ you ’s a grub-stake, an’ I’ll divvy
fair.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should advise you to.” The quiet voice was
full of meaning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will, fer fair. Will you do it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll think about it”; Westcott spoke in an ordinary
tone. “There may be a fair prospecting
chance in it,” he continued. “I’ll see you again.
I wouldn’t do any talking if I were you,” he
added.</p>

<p class='c008'>Broome regarded him with sullen scorn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think I’m a damned tenderfoot to go shootin’
off my mouth?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lawyer made no reply as he rode away,
while Broome went back into the shade. Wing
Chang, darting around a corner of the fodder-sheds,
to make sure which way he turned, came
face to face with Sandy Larch, walking in the
direction of the horse-corrals, his surprised eyes
following Westcott’s vanishing figure.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mistlee Westclott,” said Chang, noting the
foreman’s interest. “Him an’ Bloome have long
talkee-talkee out there, allee samee heap chin-chin.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So do you, you heap heathen,” replied the
foreman. “What you doin’ down here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Chinaman grinned, full of friendliness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sam Lee kid say you come look see for hog
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>lard when me gone. When come back I bling
him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He held out a broken bean-pot containing the
desired article. Sandy Larch took it, sniffing it
critically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good boy, Chang,” he said, in approval. “And
you just remember this that I tell you: Broome
an’ Mr. Westcott, they’ve most likely bin arrangin’
a series o’ Salvation Army joss meetings,
fer to convert all you Chinks. Sabbee dat?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Me sabbee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, then; you just sashay back an’ git on
your cookin’ job. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He put a broad hand on the Chinaman’s shoulder
and turned him about.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Allee lightee,” Wing Chang said, and went his
way, smiling, inscrutably.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VI</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>“I’m sure you ought to have stayed longer,”
Helen Anderson said. “Such a hurt as you
had <em>can’t</em> be well by now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard, from the saddle, thrust forth his hurt
foot and moved it about.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It <em>has</em> got well, first rate,” said he, meditatively.
“Your father can sure get his certificate off
me, any day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He spoke lightly, not glancing at the upturned,
troubled face. He spoke truthfully. His foot
was well on the road to recovery, but he knew, in
his heart of hearts, that he was running away from
the Palo Verde, and that his resolution to do so
was not very strong.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s the first time you have been on a horse
since that day,” Helen continued. “Wouldn’t you
do better to go in the buckboard, after all?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He knew that hers was but the solicitude of the
hostess; but the kindly interest of her tone was
like nectar to him. It drew his eyes to hers, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>suddenly sought his stirrup. Gard pulled himself
up with a jerk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll be all right,” said he, with a sudden stiffening
of voice and manner. “I ought to ’ve gone
before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She drew back, a little coldly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s too bad you’ve been detained,” she said,
and he could not bear it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It ain’t that,” he said, quickly. “I’d like to
stay. I don’t know how to tell you how I’d like
to stay. But I’ve got to go. And anyway, I must
be in Sylvania soon ’s possible. There’s a heap of
things I’ve got to do. I—”</p>

<p class='c008'>He realized that he was getting beyond bounds,
and was glad that Morgan Anderson came up from
the corrals just then.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here’s your last chance, if you want to
change your mind and go in the buckboard,” the
cattleman called.</p>

<p class='c008'>The buckboard, with a team of broncos driven
by one of the men, was already driving away.
Strapped at the back was Gard’s suit-case, which
Anderson had insisted upon having brought out
from the hotel in Sylvania. Gard felt quite sure
that he preferred to ride, and Anderson gave it as
his opinion that that was the best way to travel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better ’n railroad trains, or automobiles,” he
declared, and quoted, as a clincher to his opinion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“‘A good man on a good horse is nobody’s
slave.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard had been at the rancho five days; five
wonderful days, they were to him, and he felt that
he dared not stay another hour. The cattleman
had not been able to help him much, on the business
that had been his errand to the Palo Verde. Ashley
Westcott had been diligent in seeking, a couple
of years before, to learn what had become of Sawyer,
after he acknowledged the Oliphant deed to
Ed Hallard; but it had never occurred to him to
mention the young notary to Morgan Anderson.</p>

<p class='c008'>Curiously enough, however, the first person
whom Gard had asked about the notary, after
learning of Mrs. Hallard’s trouble, had referred
him to the cattleman. It was this fact that had
brought him out to the Palo Verde.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anderson remembered the young fellow. Sawyer
had “developed lungs” in Sacramento, and had
come down to the desert in search of health. He
had got better, Anderson knew, and had “gone
back inside”—he thought to San Francisco. He
gave Gard the address of a correspondent of his
own in that city, who might, he thought, be able
to furnish Sawyer’s address.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish I could have helped you more in what
you wanted to know,” Anderson said, shaking
hands with his guest. “But you come out again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>while you’re down this way, and maybe we’ll
have better luck all round.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard thanked him, and with another word or
two to Helen, rode away. Anderson stood watching
him, long after the horse and rider had become
a mere speck on the yellow desert.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s something awfully likable about that
chap, Sis,” he remarked to the girl at his side.
“But he puzzles me, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?” Helen answered, absently, and her
father glanced at her quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>What he saw seemed to reassure him. She was
bending over Patsy, whose paw had come into
painful contact with prickly pear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That means, little dog,” she told him, “that
you will have to stay at home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She searched the hurt member to make sure that
the thorns were all out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes”—she was still bent over Patsy’s foot as
she answered her father’s remark—“he is likable....
There, Patsy, don’t make a fuss.” She bound
up the paw in her handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not know that he puzzled me,” she went
on, straightening up. “I thought he seemed
rather lonely, though.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s not likely to be that, long,” was Anderson’s
reply. “It’s a thundering pity, too. I
understand he’s in deep with that Hallard woman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>though I’ve tried not to believe it. She don’t
seem his kind. I asked him to come here again,”
he went on, a little ruefully; “and yet I’m not
sure I meant it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What kind of woman is this Mrs. Hallard,
Father?” Helen regarded her father now, with
interest in her level grey eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why,” Anderson said, doubtfully. “She’s not
the kind I should think would catch him. It’s a
case of catch, all right, though, I guess; even
Westcott seemed to know about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He considered a moment, frowning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s loud, and coarse, I suppose; but she’s
a mighty handsome woman, if a man don’t care
about some other things. And I somehow should
think Gard would. I like a different sort, myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He glanced proudly at the figure beside him.
Helen was in her riding-habit, waiting for her
horse to be brought round.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But she—she’s only a rough kind, is all you
mean, isn’t it?” Her face flushed, ever so little.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Kate Hallard’s a decent sort, all right
enough, I dare say,” Anderson hastened to answer.
“Of course there’s always talk. I’ve
heard some myself, but I discounted it. In the
first place, she’s hard as nails. No nonsense
about her. Not her. Her tongue ’s tipped with
vitriol, and when she opens her mouth the men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>catch it.” Anderson shrugged his shoulder a
trifle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And then, of course,” said he, “There’s no telling
about Gard. He may be a little more attracted
than he might want to be, and yet have strength
enough to pull out of it and get away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should call that being weak, if he cared!”
cried Helen, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I don’t know.” Her father took Dickens’
bridle-rein from the puncher who had brought the
pony up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It all depends upon how a man looks at some
things,” he said, throwing the reins into place.</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen took them and prepared to mount, a hand
on the cantel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The one thing I don’t like about this way of
riding,” said Anderson, “is that it curtails our
privileges. You don’t need helping on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen sprang to the saddle, adjusting herself
with a little shake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Twould only hinder,” said she, smiling, “like
every other help we don’t need.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She flushed suddenly, as she realized that she
was quoting a saying of Gard’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You keep Patsy here, won’t you?” she called as
she rode away, leaving her father looking after
her with an expression half proud, half wistful and
wholly tender.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“She’s clean grown up,” said he, to himself, as
he stooped and snapped the leash into Patsy’s collar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The bonnie thing! Lord! How I wish her
mother was alive!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He stood staring out upon the sun-washed
desert, wide, silent, baffling, and spoke the yearning
thought of his heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know how to be a mother to her, and
she’s sure going to need one. Lord, Lord!” He
cast a comprehensive glance over the fierce, brilliant
landscape. “This is an all-right country for
men and burros,” he said, with a half-whimsical
sigh, “but it’s a mighty hard one for women and
horses!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen had promised Jacinta to ride as far as
Old Joe Papago’s, to see Mrs. Old Joe about a
young Indian girl who was to come and help
Jacinta with the work of the casa. Old Joe
was better off, financially, than any other Papago
in the section, and his wife, who was reputed to
have some Spanish blood, exercised a sort of
guardianship over the women and young girls of
their settlement. This latter was only three or
four miles distant, and there was a slight ting in
the December air that quickened Dickens’ nerves,
and made him ready for a frolic, but Helen was in
no mood to gratify him. She ignored all his invitations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>to run, and kept him to the slow little
walk of the bronco.</p>

<p class='c008'>He hated it and fretted under the steady rein;
but for once Helen did not heed him. She was
going over in her mind the events of the past five
days. Westcott, in the brief space of his hour
with her, had sought to sow the seeds of doubt of
Gard in her mind. He had spoken vaguely of certain
tricky games that the stranger was trying to
play upon him, and an imagination less pure than
the girl’s might have inferred much from the
subtle little that he let fall regarding Kate Hallard.</p>

<p class='c008'>The carefully chosen seed, however, had found
no favoring soil—no fostering care. Helen was
herself of too true and sturdy a fiber to doubt the
truth and the stability of Gard’s nature. She dismissed,
with hardly a thought, the suggestion of
trickery on his part, and the other poisoned arrows
wholly missed their intended mark.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s a lot of ways of thinking about any
one thing,” Gard had said one day, as they talked
out long, long thoughts of life, and right, “But a
man—he’s got to follow the straightest path he
sees; for he’s got to live so he can like himself,
and care to be with himself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes: that was what he would do, without fail.
He saw straight, and he would follow the straight
path. Oh! It was good to feel trust in one’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>friends! Something of the peace and serenity that
Gard himself had won out of solitude and despair
fell upon her spirit at thought of his clear vision,
and steady holding of the right.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet her heart was heavy. She told herself that
this was because she feared for the ultimate happiness
of one friend. She remembered her father’s
words about Mrs. Hallard: “coarse; hard; her
tongue tipped with vitriol.” Surely they must be
unjust, or this man, who was fine and true, would
not care. He <em>could</em> not care. Perhaps he would
come to see before it was too late, and would “pull
out and get away.” But no: that he would not
do. His was a steadfast nature; of that she was
sure!</p>

<p class='c009'>Before Old Joe Papago’s door, reins dropped to
the sand, stood a stout roan horse, and leaning
against the door-post, talking to Mrs. Old Joe, was
a woman dressed in khaki. It needed but a single
glance to tell Helen who it was.</p>

<p class='c008'>The blonde head turned as the girl rode up, and
the big black eyes surveyed her comprehensively,
but there was no sign of recognition in the hard,
impassive face. Mrs. Old Joe grunted a response
to Helen’s greeting, and the latter dismounted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Acting upon a sudden impulse she came close to
the woman by the doorway.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>“Good-morning,” she said, simply, holding out
her hand. “This is Mrs. Hallard, isn’t it? I am
Helen Anderson.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pleased to meet you,” Mrs. Hallard said, apparently
not seeing the outstretched hand. Kate
Hallard had no mind to be patronized: but she
studied the girl’s face, stealthily, and the bold eyes
grew a shade softer.</p>

<p class='c008'>She did not know that Gard had left the Palo
Verde that morning. Westcott, who had tried
hard to come to some sort of terms with her, in
the other man’s absence, had told her that the
latter would probably let himself be detained at
the rancho for a fortnight, at least. He had
drawn a vivid picture of Gard making the most
of this opportunity to win a way into Miss Anderson’s
good graces. The lawyer’s methods had
been primitive. He sought to play upon the
woman’s presumable capacity for jealousy, and
thus set her against Gard.</p>

<p class='c008'>He might have saved himself the mental wear
and tear. Kate Hallard was not a fool; nor a
devotee of the heart-complication school of fiction.
She held no illusions about Gard’s attitude toward
herself, and she had come to believe in him, passionately.
Nevertheless, Westcott’s efforts had
awakened in her a keen interest in Helen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I expect you are on the same errand as myself,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the girl was saying, determined not to be
repulsed. “Mrs. Joe keeps all the girls in her
<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">reboso</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She spoke in Spanish, that the Indian woman
might not feel left out of their talk, and the latter
smiled, toothlessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My, no!” exclaimed Mrs. Hallard. “You don’t
catch me taking on girls to look after. I’m on the
<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">buscar</span></i> for a boy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And have you succeeded?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not I! They ain’t lookin’ for work; not the
bucks; an’ she wouldn’t trust me with a girl, not
even if I’d take one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She laughed, defiantly, and the young girl
divined, instinctively, that she did so because
she was ill at ease. She stood looking at her, wistfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>Did Gabriel Gard really love this woman? Was
she really coarse, and hard, and vitriolic of tongue,
as her father had said? It could not be; or such
a man could not care. There <em>must</em> be another side,
and shame be upon her, Helen Anderson, if she
could not win it to the surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder—” she began, with some hesitation.
“Of course I don’t know what you want, but Wing
Chang, our cook, has a young cousin—or something—visiting
him. He came a few days ago,
with some teamsters from the mines. I think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Chang does not want to take him on. He was
scolding about it, yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The defiance was gone from Mrs. Hallard’s
face, and a little look of friendliness crept among
its hard lines.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, if he’s old enough to wait on table,”
said she, “I dare say he’d be just what I want.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh,” Helen replied, “I know that he can do
that. He must be about sixteen years old, and he
<em>has</em> waited in restaurants.” She did not add that
that was one reason why neither she nor Chang
cared for the lad’s services. “Why can’t you ride
back to the rancho with me and see him yourself?”
she asked, instead.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, I’d take it right good of you if I could,”
Kate Hallard said, after a moment’s hesitation.
Mrs. Old Joe had departed to find the mother of
Jacinta’s prospective handmaiden, and they were
speaking English.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Tain’t no meanness in me that won’t have a
girl round,” she added, as if wishing to set herself
right with her hearer, “but I want some one to
sling victuals, at the grille, an’ I can’t have any
half-baked girl-squaws round. Men’s devils; I
can’t look after them an’ girls too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” Helen spoke in impulsive protest, and
Mrs. Hallard’s laugh was hard again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t believe what I said about men, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>guess,” she said, and Helen answered very simply:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course not; it couldn’t be true you know,
so long as women are not—what you said.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ain’t so sure about the women—not most of
’em—” Mrs. Hallard’s handsome face wore a
sneer now.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anyway,” she argued, “they’s plenty of ’em
doin’ their share o’ the devil’s business in the
world.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But there <em>are</em> good men,” Helen persisted, “and
good women, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right you are about there bein’ some,” was the
reply; “but I draw the line at there bein’ many.
I’ve lived in this world thirty years, nearly, child,
an’ I ain’t found such a lot. I know <em>one</em> good
man though.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her face softened, and at the sight a thrill
stirred Helen’s pulses. She felt sure that Mrs.
Hallard was speaking of Gard. There <em>was</em> softness
under that hard shell after all.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before she could say anything more, however,
Mrs. Old Joe returned to the hut with the Papago
girl and her mother, and she set her mind to the
faithful performance of Jacinta’s errand. It was
quickly arranged that the handmaiden should be
brought at once to the Palo Verde, and the matter
completed, the two white women rode away together.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>A soft wind was blowing across their faces; a
wind full of the essential odor of the desert: impalpable,
a little acrid, bracing withal, and subtly
suggestive of mystery, and of vastness. Helen
threw back her head, yielding to the desert spell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” she cried, “this is the place to be, after
all. Don’t you feel so about it?” she demanded of
her companion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know,” Kate Hallard was watching
her, puzzled. “I never was away from it. Sometimes
it makes me ache.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ache?” It was the girl’s turn to be mystified.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.” The woman could not have told why
the hidden thoughts of her heart suddenly became
articulate at this girl’s invitation to speech.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It always seems to me as if the desert—wants
something,” she explained, hesitatingly. “I
d’ know what ’tis, but the feeling’s there: a sort
of emptiness, as if it wanted to cry and couldn’t.
Sometimes at night, when I hear a burro ‘yee-haw,’
or a coyote howlin’, seems to me like’s if, if the
desert <em>could</em> cry that’s the kind o’ noise it would
make. It’s like lonesome women—if there’s any
sense in that!” she added with a half-ashamed
laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen’s heart was full of sympathy that she felt
was but partially understanding. So this was what
the desert had brought to this hard-seeming woman.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>She had a sudden sorry realization that the marvelous
waste had never told its ache to her, dearly
as she loved it, and with the realization came the
knowledge that the woman beside her understood
because she had truly lived and suffered in it. It
came to her to wonder if Gard had ever felt the
ache of the desert.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you ever want to get away from it?” she
asked, softly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I d’ know,” her companion considered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ain’t never known what anything else is like,”
she finally said, helplessly, “but seems to me you
git to feel like’s if you was part of the desert, an’
something would break if you got too far off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ah! <em>That</em> Helen knew. She had hungered for
the desert, even if she had never ached with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s the place of places for me,” cried she, taking
off her hat and letting the wind stir her hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>Kate Hallard studied her, wonderingly. She
had known few women in her life; never before
so youthful a one. She wondered what Gabriel
Gard had thought of this girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Gard’s at the rancho ain’t he?” she asked,
and Helen’s cheek paled for an instant. The older
woman noted the fact with a fierce little pang.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He went back to Sylvania this morning,” Helen
answered, and the other looked her surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t suppose he’d git away so quick,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>said. “Sandy Larch was in yesterday an’ said he
was in for another week. If I’d known he was
comin’ in I wouldn’t a’ gone off,” she added, and a
sense of the desert’s ache crept into Helen’s own
heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes: Mrs. Hallard was right: it <em>was</em> a lonely
place.</p>

<p class='c009'>Arrived at the Palo Verde, the girl called Wing
Chang, telling him the business of the moment,
and directed him to send in his young relative.
Then she took Mrs. Hallard to her own room, a
big, low-ceilinged place, with wide windows looking
out toward the far mountains. Kate gazed
about her wistfully. She had seen few women’s
rooms in her lifetime.</p>

<p class='c008'>This one was the sort of composite suggestion of
dear girl and nice boy that the modern college
girl’s room is apt to be. Cushions blazoned with
the initials of Radcliffe and of Harvard heaped a
couch covered with the skin of a mountain lion
that Helen herself had shot. Among the pretty
trifles on the dresser was a practical-looking little
revolver, and from one of the two hooks that held
her light rifle hung an illumined panel bearing the
arms of Radcliffe. A cartridge-belt hung from
another hook, and beneath it, on a stand, lay a bit
of dainty embroidery which she had been working
on that very morning.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Beside it was a fat little book bound in age-yellowed
vellum. Kate Hallard picked this up and
glanced through it, curiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is this Chinese?” she asked, bewildered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen explained that it was Greek, and the
woman laid it down with a weary little laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ain’t never been out’n the territory, as I said,”
she explained, half defiantly. “Men’s about the
only books I ever read, an’ Lord! <em>they’re</em> mostly
writ plainer’n that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I haven’t known many,” Helen answered, “except
my father—and one or two others.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“One or two’s likely to be samples o’ the rest,”
the other remarked, carelessly. “I suppose you
know an awful lot?” she continued, glancing at
Helen’s book-shelves. She had never before seen
so many books together.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know just enough to realize that I am dreadfully
ignorant.” Helen’s face was troubled; the
older woman yearned toward her. She, alas!
could think of nothing in her own experience that
was likely to be of use to the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wing Chang’s cousin just at this instant appeared,
silently, in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Lee,” Helen cried; “Mrs. Hallard wants
to see you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Chang say come,” the boy replied, “I come
quick’s could. Me velly good waiter boy,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>added without preamble, turning to Kate Hallard.
“Thinkee takee your job.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Land sakes!” laughed she; “he’s none so slow,
is he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you wait on customers as prompt as all
that?” she asked of the boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Me velly good boy,” he repeated, gravely,
“makee hash fli allee same like hellee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lee!” Helen looked shocked. “You should
wait to see whether Mrs. Hallard wants you,” she
finished, rather tamely.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lee looked at her in surprise. “No can help,” he
announced, conclusively, “China boy velly scarce;
no can get many; him got take me; one velly good
boy.” He glanced again at Mrs. Hallard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I go get clo’,” he concluded, imperturbably.
“Go skippee Sylvania. See you later.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was gone, without circumlocution, and Helen
surveyed her visitor a little helplessly. “I’ll have
Chang talk to him,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No need,” laughed the other. “But my!
He’s sure something of a hustler, that boy. I
reckon I’d better hit the trail or he’ll be runnin’
the grille before I git to it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you really think he will do for you?”
Helen was somewhat dismayed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure,” was the reply. “He’ll do first rate. He
means well; don’t I know Chinks?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>“You have to take ’em the way they mean,” she
added, philosophically. “That’s the way to git
along with ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You seem to know a great deal,” murmured
Helen, wistfully. She felt somehow very young
and inexperienced.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you’ll see Mr. Gard when you get
home,” she added, tentatively. “We—that is—Father
was afraid he ought not to go so soon—on
account of his foot. We hope it will be all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again Kate Hallard crushed down the little
pang that would come.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Gard, he took hold of a little piece o’ business
for me...” she spoke very casually, “I
reckon it’s bothering him a lot. I expect he wants
to get done with it an’ git away from here. He’s
been mighty kind about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! He would be that.” Helen could not
have explained why her heart seemed suddenly
lighter. She was conscious of a quick, friendly
feeling toward this woman of the desert.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll come again to see me, won’t you?” she
asked, detaining her guest when the latter had
swung to the saddle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Kate Hallard hesitated. “I reckon I can’t git
away from the grille much,” she said, evasively.
“I never go nowhere much.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl’s instinctive wisdom prompted her not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>to press the point then. She would let it wait, but
her wistfulness sounded in her voice when she
spoke again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“At any rate we’re friends, are we not?” queried
she, looking up into the black eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>They returned her gaze with a sudden glisten,
as of ice-bound pools when Spring has touched
them. In their fundamental honesty the two natures
stood for the moment upon common ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Friends.” Kate Hallard drew a long breath
as she took up her bridle-rein. “Child,” she said,
“if the friendship of a woman like me is ever any
use to you, it’s yours while there’s a drop o’ blood
in my heart,” and ere Helen could make answer
she was well down the avenue toward the great
gate.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The days immediately following his return to
Sylvania were hard ones for Gard. The few
cautious inquiries he had dared to make in the investigation
of his own affairs had resulted in the
information that Jim Texas was dead and that
Hart Dowling had left Wyoming and gone on
into Idaho. Gard’s messenger had been unable to
get to him on account of the deep snow.</p>

<p class='c008'>He read the letter containing this news lying
coatless upon the sand, far beyond the town. The
desert was his one solace in the enforced idleness
of waiting for word from Sawyer, for which he
had written to San Francisco. The vast barren
seemed in tune with his own mood.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fierceness of his ache was there; the yearning
of his solitude: he tried to picture the vast sea
of sand overgrown with verdure, calling up cool
visions of tree and pool, and gentle growths born
of the small spring rain on the green grass. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>picture came before him like a memory of delicious
holidays in lush woods.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was but a vision however. The scent of the
desert was in his nostrils; the impress of the desert
upon his brain. He opened his eyes and saw again
the silent reaches of the waste—wide, untamed, untamable—and
sat up, the better to view the lean
landscape.</p>

<p class='c008'>At his first movement a jack-rabbit, observing
him from beneath a cholla, gathered its swift hind-legs
under him and fled, with incredible rapidity,
before the shadow of fear. Gard laughed, but
there was underneath his amusement a sense of the
constant deadly strife of the place. If he had no
designs upon the jack-rabbit, plenty of other creatures
had. The lurking snake that lay in wait to
take him subtly; the lank coyote, more cunning
than he, if not so swift; even the Gila monster,
slow and hideous; the savage, sneaking wild-cat,
and the little hydrophobia skunk, were constantly
on the alert to surprise those wide-open eyes and
ears. These all preyed upon him, and upon one
another, caught in the endless struggle of the
desert, moved upon by constant need to sustain
life, and to hold it against all other life.</p>

<p class='c008'>The thought brought Gard to a sharpened sense
of his own danger, and of the enemies who, if they
but knew, would be so quick to hunt and harry him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>The savagery of it all smote him with a keener
desolation. The armed vegetation, grotesque and
menacing; the preying creatures of the plain; the
sand-laden wind that was constantly tearing down
and rebuilding the shifting scene—were not all
these but a commentary upon the mad, devouring
human world about him?</p>

<p class='c008'>But the wind that laid bare the earth’s nakedness
clothed and healed as well, purifying the air and
cleansing the waste. The give as well as the take
of life was there. Death was in the desert, but not
decay. Gard, feeling it all in the whirl of his emotions,
knew that the grim plain which mothered the
whole fierce brood had mothered him as well, giving
him back health and strength from her own
burning heart, and he loved her, as her children must.</p>

<p class='c008'>His thoughts turned inevitably to the glade. He
had a whimsical idea that his trouble would all
seem easier if he could but talk it over with Jinny.
Deep down, however, he knew better. Not even
to that faithful listener could he have voiced the
longing of his whole nature for Helen Anderson.
He cherished the thought of her in his secret heart,
going over, minute by minute, the hours they had
spent together. Each word of hers, each look, gesture,
had its special power of endearment!</p>

<p class='c008'>What if he were to tell her the whole story,
would she believe him? Would she consent to go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>away with him into a new life? He could realize
enough from the mine to make such a life full of
rich possibilities, and there were far countries
enough!</p>

<p class='c008'>But what sort of a man would it be, who could
ask the woman he loved to help him live a lie? He
asked himself the question and awoke to a realization
of his further folly. What right had he even
to dream of her—to imagine that she could ever
care for him at all? Even though he should stand
before her without a shadow in his past he would
be a brave man who dared raise his eyes to her.
How could he, of all men?</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he remembered Westcott. He had seen
with his own eyes that <em>he</em> dared. Could that man
ever hope to win her?</p>

<p class='c008'>The torture of this thought drove him out over
the desert at noon, when the sky closed brassy-yellow
above him, and the heat-reddened air over the
sand seemed the hue of his own thoughts. He
fought his way through it to peace, far out in the
open, when the afternoon wind was driving the
heat of the plain skyward, and seaward over the
mountains, and he came back against that cleansing
breath, his wonted strong self, to a conference
with Kate Hallard. She was bitter against Westcott
that day, breathing out wrath, and the desire
for vengeance.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>“If you’ve ever noticed it,” Gard said, “there’s
a kind of reasonableness in the way things happen,
even when they look black. They happen out of
each other; and there’s Something managing
them, no matter how it looks, sometimes. I’ve
found that out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like to help in the managin’,” Mrs. Hallard
said, grimly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You couldn’t.” Gard shook his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You couldn’t see the whole scheme,” he continued.
“And we don’t need to want to. Whoever’s
doing it is making up a whole piece out of
’em. That’s this world we’re in. It’s our world.
We belong in it; and there ain’t anything in it for
us to be afraid of but just ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He pondered his own saying for a moment, repeating
it as if to reassure himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s sure right.” He took up the thread
again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It makes me think of a game I played once at a
party I went to, when I was a kid, back in the
states. They had a big, round paper apple fixed
up, with something in it for each of us; and we
each had a string given us to follow up till we
came to the end and each found what belonged to
him. Ever see anything like that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Hallard nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“They worked a game o’ that sort once at some
Christmas doin’s where I was raised. Did you
ever think o’ me goin’ to Sunday School?” she
asked, with a bitter little laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure I did.” Gard went on with his simile.
“A man’s got to hold on to his own string,” he
said. “And follow it up till he gets to the core of
the apple. He’ll find his own share there. This
Westcott, he’s trying to haul on other folkses’
lines, as well’s his own, and that gets things in a
mix-up. We’ve got to try and make him play the
thing right; but it ain’t our party, and therefore
it ain’t our job to throw him out of the game altogether.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Hallard’s brows were knit in the effort to
follow. She had not herself learned, as yet, to
lean upon the logic of events, and vengeance was a
part of her own theory of life. Then, because she
seemed to find no thoroughfare through the subject,
she turned abruptly away from it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I met up with your Miss Helen Anderson yesterday,”
she said, suddenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The light in Gard’s face was revealing, but he
merely stood, expectant, until she had told him the
whole of the encounter at Old Joe Papago’s, even
to Helen’s proffer of friendship.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bless her!” the man murmured, with face illumined.
“Ain’t she a brick, though?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“She’s better ’n a brick,” said Kate Hallard,
promptly. “She’s a real woman, with a lovin’ honest
heart. Look here, Mr. Gabriel Gard! Be you
goin’ to stand round with your quirt in your hand,
while that there Westcott devil rides off the range
with her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard’s face was pale, and the sweat stood upon
his forehead.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t!” cried he, sharply. “You don’t know
what you’re talking about! A man’s got to follow
his own line, I tell you, and get it clear before
him, before he asks any woman to take hold of it
with him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned abruptly and left her. Yes: that was
what he must do. Whatever was to be met, he
must meet it, and clear the way, before he took one
step nearer Helen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it’s hard to wait,” he muttered, pacing the
desert with clenched hands; “hard as wickedness!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The stage that night brought him a letter from
San Francisco. Sawyer, it told him, had left the
city. The writer believed that he had gone to Arizona
for the winter. He was thought to be somewhere
on a ranch in the neighborhood of the Navajo
reservation. Gard read that with a little feeling
of dismay. He did not care to go up there.
He had grown confident that he was not likely to
be recognized; but still, there was danger, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>wanted to keep clear of complications until such
time as he was ready to act for himself. If anything
should happen to him he had no one to take
up his work on the outside. He must find someone
whom he could trust.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly he bethought himself of Sandy Larch.
They were friends. He could trust Sandy, and he
would.</p>

<p class='c008'>He spent a long time that evening, writing a letter
of instructions for Sandy Larch to read, in the
event of any failure in his own plans. This he put
carefully inside a worn memorandum book, and
did the whole up in a neat packet which he meant
to leave with the foreman, together with a heavy
money-belt which he was then himself wearing. If
necessity arose he would have to trust much to the
foreman’s shrewd judgment in action, but at least
he would fix things so that Sandy should not be
acting in the dark.</p>

<p class='c008'>He got an early start in the morning, and rode
out to the Palo Verde. Morgan Anderson was
away. He had left at daylight, to go down into
Mexico, Sandy Larch explained, on some mining
business. Incidentally, he was going to see about
some choice lemon trees that he had set his heart
upon, and before their arrival ground must be broken
to receive them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So it’s up to us to git them workin’ cows gentled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>an’ onto their job,” the foreman told Gard;
“We’re goin’ to bust ’em out right now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say,” he added, “That lawyer-sharp ’s here.
Came down last night, to see the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">patron</span></i>; he’s
goin’ on to Sylvania, I guess. He said somethin’
about it, awhile ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I came out to see you on a little business matter,
Sandy,” Gard had begun, when one of the
cow-punchers demanded the foreman’s attention.
Ere he could turn back to Gard, Westcott came
down from the casa and mounted his horse which
was standing at the rail.</p>

<p class='c008'>He greeted Gard curtly. “Going to stay and see
the fun?” He queried, with a jaunty air of being
entirely at home. “I think I will, too. We’ll be
glad to have you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The future working-stock had been removed to
an outlying corral, to make room for the horses the
men had been working out. The Palo Verde was
short of men that season, and Sandy was obliged
to plan his work carefully. The punchers who
were to break in the cattle were grouped now, and
ready for the fray.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on,” the foreman called to Gard, who
had tossed his saddlebags down in front of Sandy’s
shack, and the outfit went tearing across the sand
to the outer corrals.</p>

<p class='c008'>A wagon and a plow had been hauled out to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>scene of action the night before. The principles
of gentling the steers were brief and fundamental.
Two punchers threw their ropes over the horns of
one big brute and dragged him out upon the desert,
while two others brought up his yoke-fellow. Once
yoked and hitched, with a riata from the horns of
each to the saddle-horn of a good man on a clever
pony, to tow them along, the creatures could move
forward, or die in their tracks. When, as was
usual, they decided to do the former, they were
considered gentled. Their future, thereafter, was
in the keeping of the Mexican who might have
them in hand to plow with.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hullo, you heap heathen!” Sandy Larch called
out to the Chinese cook in the big wagon as the
outfit came thundering up. “How’d you git out
here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wing Chang grinned, as was his habit whenever
the foreman addressed him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Heap tallee fun,” he explained. “Me come
look see.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sandy Larch and Manuel had already brought
out a steer. Broome threw his rope next, cursing
roundly at the greenhorn who was helping him,
and whose first wild throw covered the horns of
the wrong animal. Since it would be quicker work
for him to change than for the other, Broome released
his “cow,” the big steer that had run him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>from the corral the week before, and took hold
with the greenhorn.</p>

<p class='c008'>The brutes were yoked and hitched to the
wagon, and the fun began with Chang’s precipitate
and unpremeditated departure from the vehicle.
He rolled over and got to his feet as the cowboys
started out over the sand, pell-mell, “pully haul,” in
a medley of shrieks and oaths and thunderous bellowings.
The spectators of the proceedings kept
along upon the flanks of the procession, shouting
encouragement or derision to the sweating cowboys
as they galloped, and occasionally lending a
hand so far as to lean over and apply the spur to one
or the other resisting “bos.” In two minutes’ time
the wildly gyrating mass was well out on the plain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then from the corral came the sound of a sudden
crash. A huge red and white bulk hurled itself
over the bars, and the steer that Broome had released
came charging out, mad with rage and fear.</p>

<p class='c008'>For an instant he stood dazed by the success of
his own exploit. None of the other cattle had followed.
He alone had possessed the wit and prowess
to essay the barrier, one bar of which the
greenhorn had failed to secure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great brute’s hesitation was brief. For an
instant he pawed the sand, bellowing challenge to
the world; then, head down and tail up, he started
like a streak of lightning for the only man on foot.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Wing Chang had already realized his danger,
and was flying for his life, his pigtail streaming behind
him, his yellow face distorted by fright. The
outfit wheeled and took notice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wow! Wow! Fli’ gun. Allee samee fli’ gun!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The high-pitched shrieks of the terrified Chinamen
rose above the noise of hoofs, the shouts of
men, the bellowing of cattle. On he sped, the
mighty bulk of his pursuer flashing along in what
looked like a continuous streak of red, behind
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hell!” One of the punchers ejaculated. “It’s
us to be hunting a new cook!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The next instant his bronco’s heels were twinkling
as he raced to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard had already started. He had no rope, but
he was nearest the scene, and he saw, as did the
others, that no rope could be flung in time. He
was sending his pony along at full speed, minded
to get in and head “bos” off. It was Wing Chang’s
only hope.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great steer was already perilously near,
when the Chinaman stumbled, falling his full
length on the sand. His yells still pierced the air
in high falsetto, and his feet continued the motions
of running, flinging up and down with the regularity
of pistons as his long yellow fingers clutched
the desert.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Down came the foe! An instant, and the thing
would be done; but in between him and his yelling
victim flashed a man and a horse, and Gard, reaching
down, caught the Chinaman by the belt.</p>

<p class='c008'>A quick, skilful jerk brought him up as the pony
dashed on, and in the same instant the cowboy’s
rope caught the steer by one upflung hind hoof.
The great brute turned a clean somersault in the
air, and landed with a crash upon his back.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard, keeping hold of the Chinaman, brought
his horse to a standstill near a great branching
suhuaro, and set the still vociferating Wing Chang
upon his feet. The cowboys already had two
ropes over the recalcitrant steer, and were leading
him back to the corral, minus one long, murderous
horn, and greatly chastened in spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was high noon before the three pairs of cattle
were gentled sufficiently to permit of their being
yoked without absolute danger to life. By that
time each “yoke” had pulled the wagon a quarter
of a mile, with more or less sobriety, and had
plowed a torturous furrow on the desert.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Which I would rise in my place,” Sandy Larch
said, seriously, “an’ point with pride at them yoke
o’ cows as a good morning’s work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He and Gard had ridden back together, and
were in the foreman’s shack. Westcott had gone
on his way to Sylvania.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>“I want you to do something for me, Sandy,”
Gard said. “I’ve got to go up north, and I want
to leave—”</p>

<p class='c008'>His hand sought an inner pocket as he spoke,
and he drew it out with a look of dismay. Then he
began searching his other pockets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lost something?” the foreman said, watching
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—should—say—I—had!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The full significance of his loss was telegraphing
itself to the inner strongholds of Gard’s consciousness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sandy!” He sprang to his feet. “I’ve got to
find it—in a hurry, too!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was outside, now, looking for his horse,
which had been turned in to feed with the others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll rustle a couple more,” Sandy said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord!” he thought, “Something’s eatin’ him.
I never thought I’d see <em>him</em> in a flurry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They were ready in a moment, and riding back
to the ground they had gone over in the forenoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You kin bet your hat you let it go overboard
when you reached fer that blasted Chink,” Sandy
said, and they made for the spot where Gard had
rescued Wing Chang.</p>

<p class='c008'>But no brown packet rewarded their scrutiny of
the ground. They paced the desert on to where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Gard had set the Chinaman on his feet, and found
nothing but the hole of a Gila monster. Sandy
kicked it open with his heel, and the occupant came
up, hissing hideously, but that was all.</p>

<p class='c008'>They circled the whole ground of the morning’s
operations, but without result, and at last they returned
to the shack. Gard’s face was drawn in
haggard lines, but he had recovered his poise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I reckon that thing’s got tromped down into
the ground,” Sandy said, by way of consolation. “I
didn’t see none of the boys pick up nothin’.
They’d a’ hollered if they had, an’ we was all together.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All except Westcott.” Gard spoke very quietly,
but Sandy shouted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gosh! That’s so,” He cried, “I fergot him fer
a minute. I swan! Would it be mighty bad if he
was the one to find it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A little worse, in some ways, than anybody
else living.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord! Lord! But I don’t see how he could,
Gard: He rode off to Sylvania. It’s happened the
way I said. They was a mighty lot o’ hoofs rampaging
round there, an’ your goods, whatever
’t was, got tromped in; but you can bet Sandy
Larch’ll keep his peepers open fer’t if it’s on top
the ’arth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anyway,”—Gard roused himself—“there’s all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>the more reason why I should do what I’ve got to
do while I can.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was undressing as he spoke, and presently
produced the belt.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want you to put this away somewhere,
Sandy,” he said. “If I send you word to do some
things for me it may come in handy. And Sandy,
if anything happens to me you go and see Mrs.
Hallard, and do what you can to help her. She’ll
need help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Not a flicker moved the serenity of the foreman’s
steady eyes. His was not the friendship that
questions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll do anything you send word to do, Gard,”
said he, “but I don’t believe I’ll need all that
money. You got plenty to use?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure—” with a sigh. “Money ain’t the thing I
need most, Sandy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bless yourself for that,” was the quick reply.
“When it comes to a pinch the filthy’s one of the
things inconvenient to miss.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He put the belt away in his own secret hiding-place
and busied himself with getting up his
friend’s horse. Gard meant to ride to Bonesta, and
there board the train. If, as he suspected, Westcott
had found that tell-tale packet, he must himself
move quickly, and settle Mrs. Hallard’s matter
before he could be apprehended as a fugitive from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>justice. Not that Gard meant to be apprehended.
But he did not intend that any thought of risk to
his personal safety should interfere with the discharge
of his duty as he saw it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So long, Sandy,” he said, out beyond the corrals.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adios!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sandy gripped his hand heartily, and the two
men parted; but Gard made a wide detour, ere he
took the desert road, to glimpse from afar the low-walled
casa, white in the glaring December sunlight.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had left the Palo Verde well behind, and
was in a little sandy valley, the dry bed of some
ancient lake, when he dismounted to tighten his
saddle cincha. Pausing an instant, before remounting,
he cast a weary glance skyward and
gave a cry of surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>High in the ether an enchanted landscape, huge,
distorted, hung before his vision. Rocks and trees,
vast cacti and shimmering plain were there, and
moving among them were a horse and rider, followed
by a dog.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no mistaking the figures. Helen,
upon Dickens, was riding on the plain, Patsy keeping
her company. The blessed mirage showed
them plainly and Gard gazed, dizzy with emotion.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was but a fleeting vision. Some movement of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>the upper air-currents disturbed it and even as he
looked it broke into fragments, dissolved and was
gone, ere Gard’s swelling heart had ceased its wild
pounding.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is out there in the desert,” he murmured, a
sobbing catch in his throat, “Oh, God bless her! I
love her! I love her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He mounted his horse again and rode on, his
heart light as a feather, and on his lips the words
of a half-forgotten old song.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Gard had not been wrong in his reading of the
mirage. It <em>was</em> Helen whose presentment
that marvel of the desert had set like a bow of
promise in the sky. A mood of restlessness had
sent the girl forth seeking refuge in the sunlit candor
of the plain from the fear that was upon her,
of hidden chambers in her own soul, which she
shrank from entering.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was very quiet. From time to time Dickens,
the pony, turned to nip playfully first one then the
other of her hooded stirrups, inviting her to a
frolic. Once, when a parcel of gaunt Indian dogs
went vociferating along a stretch of mesa, within
sight and hearing, he broke into a sympathetic
scamper, Patsy joining him ecstatically. The rise
from a walk to a run was sudden and unexpected,
but the girl adapted herself to it indifferently, with
the instinctive adjustment of perfect horsemanship.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pony ran gallantly for a little distance, waiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>all the while, expectantly, for the thrill of answering
pleasure in motion that failed to come
along the rein. One inquiring eye rolled back at
his mistress, one fine, pointed ear slanted to catch
her least word of command, but Helen was far
away and he watched and listened in vain for some
hint that she realized his coaxing. Dickens could
not understand it. He stretched his graceful neck
as he ran, still seeking that answering touch of the
bit. Helen’s ready hand gave lightly to his thrust,
her muscles responding with trained certainty to
his every movement, but Dickens wanted her conscious
attention. When that was not forthcoming
his pace slackened under the retarding weight of
her laden spirit. He drooped his head and went
half-heartedly, following Patsy, whose vagabond
whim had led him from the road.</p>

<p class='c008'>A feeling of oppression was on the girl. Not
even the cleansing touch of the north-west wind,
blowing from the far mountains, seemed potent to
ease it. Somehow, the desert solitude had grown
all at once more complex than ever the busy, active
city life had been. The well-loved plain lay all
about her as of old, fraught with all its remembered
delight, yet imminent with a new mystery.
Some message, luring yet baffling, quivered
through it. The far blue hills, the golden-roseate
sky, the shimmering, wind-stirred air, breathed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>life; but the grim waste, yellow, seared, ancient,
the scant, spectral trees, the uncouth cacti, warned,
rather, to thoughts of death; and something deep
within her was subtly aware of another summons
still, which her soul half shrank from heeding, half
yearned to understand.</p>

<p class='c008'>She drew rein presently, as she realized that
they were off the trail. At the base of a mass of
rock Patsy was scratching frantically at a hole in
the earth where a burrowing owl had just disappeared.
A carrion crow, disturbed in its tentative
investigation of something that lay on the ground,
rose complainingly and flapped itself darkly away.</p>

<p class='c008'>Looking about her Helen came to slow realization
of the spot. There were the rocks round
which she had come that marvelous morning.
Here Gard had lain, Patsy just where she and
Dickens stood. Yonder slender thread of pearly
vertebra that the raven had been turning over was
all that was left of the menace that had lifted itself
just there that day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Second by second she went over the scene, seeing
again the spell-bound dog, the flat-headed, venomous
snake, the prostrate man, with his serene
gaze, his dark eyes telegraphing reassurance to her
from the heart of his own deadly peril.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh,” she shuddered, feeling again the sense of
horror and faintness that had been hers on that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>morning, “What if no one had come! What if I
could not have saved him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She buried her face in her hands, shutting out
the scene, but she could not shut out the memory
of those haunting eyes. She saw them still, but
now they were troubled, and eloquent of struggle,
as they had seemed while he was saying good-by,
that morning at the Palo Verde. The girl had
wondered, more than once, over that look, so
quickly withdrawn. Now she suddenly understood
it through the quick response which, at the
memory, leaped from her own heart; and she
knew, deep down in those recesses which she had
shrunk from looking upon, that she had understood
all the time.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mantling crimson swept her face as she sat
there, startled, still keeping her hands up, as
though to hide it from her own thoughts. She
went over in her mind all those days at the rancho,
measuring every look, every gesture, weighing
every word of Gard’s that seemed to afford comfort
to her shamed heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He went away without a word,” she finally
whispered, raising her head. “But I know I can
trust him. There was some good reason why he
had to go away; but he will come back! Oh, he
will come back to me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The glory of the skies became all at once part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>the brightness that filled her spirit. The girl’s heart
was suddenly lifted on mysterious wings into the
wider spaces of womanhood. She had heard the
message, and was aware.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet there was visible as she turned away, but a
slender figure in khaki, browned as to cheek and
brow, touched to warmth by the desert wind, guiding
a dun pony among the rocks and cacti back to
the trail.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dusty thread of its way picked up once
more, Helen suddenly awoke to outward things; to
the challenge of the north-west wind, and the
eager outstretch of the horse she rode. The least
imperceptible lift of her bridle arm conveyed to
Dickens the welcome news that his mistress answered
him. Something of her soul’s exultation
thrilled through the pony and set his twinkling feet
to dancing, and on the instant they were racing
pell-mell across the desert, Patsy, wild with joy,
careering beside them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen laughed aloud for sheer delight as they
sped forward. She stood in her stirrups and sent
Dickens ahead, holding him steady but making no
effort to check the wild pace, the wind bearing all
care from her brain, all doubt from her heart, as
they swept on toward the Palo Verde.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well!” Sandy Larch said, coming to take the
pony’s rein as Helen swung down beside the corrals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“You sure was goin’ some. I kind o’ thought
for a minute Dickens was runnin’ with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” laughed Helen, still breathless and exultant
with the excitement of the race, “<em>I</em> was running
with Dickens.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sandy loosened the cincha and eased the saddle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll leave it that a’way till his back cools
out,” said he, “You’ve sure warmed him up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned an approving glance upon the girl as
she stood rubbing Dickens’ dun-colored nose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You look good Miss Helen,” he said. “I’d begun
to be afraid they’d educated all the life an’
brightness out’n you back there to your eastern college.
I guess, though, you’ll get over it in time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get over the education, Sandy?” she suggested,
mischievously; she and Sandy had been pals since
her babyhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d be sorry if I should,” she added. “Think
what a loss it would be.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” he assented, gravely, “It sure would.
They’s the prices of a right smart o’ good polo ponies
gone into polishin’ you off like you be.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was comin’ to think,” he went on, his face
awakening genially, “that you was most likely
pinin’ for them shiny pursuits more’n you allowed
for when you first come back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a bit of it, Sandy!” Helen’s tone was emphatic,
“I enjoyed every moment at college; but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>came back to the desert knowing perfectly well
that this is the best place in the world.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her hearty tone satisfied even his jealous ears.
The girl had stooped to caress Patsy, who lay panting
on the sand, his tongue fluttering like a little
red signal-flag. Her eyes were bright and happy,
her cheeks touched to a brilliant glow by her run
with Dickens. Sandy nodded again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” he said, “I guess it ain’t hurt you none.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?” Helen had forgotten what they had
been talking about. She looked up absently, still
rubbing Patsy’s sides.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Education,” the foreman said, “I was afraid
mebby it had.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense, Sandy, Education doesn’t hurt
people.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“N-o-,” Sandy’s acquiescence was deliberative.
“Not people o’ intellectooals, that has <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">savez</span></i> naturally,”
he said, “but the critter that gets it fed to him
regular wants to be kind o’ wide between the ears
allee samee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t you enjoy going to school when you
were a boy, Sandy?” Helen asked; she loved to
draw the cow-puncher out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Me?” he questioned, unsuspectingly, “Sure:
I’d a liked it first rate if I’d ever a’ went.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never did go none till I was growed,” he went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>on. “Then we started a night-school, back to
Michigan, where I was raised. They was a bunch
of us set out to see it through, all young fellers that
worked the farms day-times. We was plum in
love with the idee o’ that night-school.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It must have been interesting,” Helen suggested,
“You would all have a strong purpose at
that age.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure,” Sandy grew reminiscent. “We went
the first night,” he said, “An’ we’d forgot to bring
any candles. We went the next night an’ the
teacher’d forgot to come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He gazed across the plain, lost in memory of
those far, fond days. “Then we went the third
night,” he resumed, dreamily, “an’ reviewed what
we’d learned the two previous evenin’s, and’ I cal’late
that finished my schoolin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen laughed, tweaking Patsy’s ears, but the
foreman regarded her with mild inquiry, unheeding
her mirth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now with you it’s different Miss Helen,” he
continued, still considering his views on education.
“Gettin’ learnin’ ’s all right for you. First place
you’re smart.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you,” Helen bowed over Patsy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re sure welcome,” gravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Furthermore,” Sandy proceeded categorically,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“You bein’ a girl, you don’t have to get your livin’.
A man now, a practical man that’s gotter rustle his
grub, don’t wanter pack no extry outfit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned toward Dickens, who all this time had
been standing half asleep, his bridle reins on the
ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dick, he’s gettin’ on, ain’t he,” the foreman
said, critically, “but he stands up to it mighty well,
yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now there’s a case where education’s o’
value,” added Sandy in a tone of pride, “I educated
that there horse myself, purpose for you, little gal,
an’ they ain’t no question but Dick’s lived up to his
light. I’ll have Manuel give ’im a rub-down.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dickens is a treasure,” declared Helen, emphatically.
“He’s as good as ever; aren’t you,
Dickens?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She patted the pony’s glossy neck. “Have you
found another Manuel already, Sandy,” she queried,
“I thought Manuel Gordo had been discharged.
Father said he would have to be.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Same old Manuel,” was Sandy’s reply. “But
he’s kind o’ got some new notions in his headpiece
lately, along of our sin-bustin’ friend Mister Gard
gettin’ after ’im last time he started onto a spree.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?” His hearer was deeply interested in examining
Dickens’ sound little knees, and did not
look up.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>“Why do you call Mr. Gard your sin-busting
friend, Sandy?” she asked, still intent upon the
pony. Nothing loth, the foreman plunged into an
enthusiastic account of his first meeting with Gard.
Helen listened, her cheeks still glowing from exercise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never got the rights o’ how he took hold o’
Manuel,” Sandy said, when the story was finished,
“Manuel, he ain’t talkin’ none about it; but he
started out on one o’ his regular imbibin’ bees,
which same the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">patron</span></i>’d give out was n’t to be
overlooked again, an’ all I know is he comes home
all right next mornin’ an’ gets on his job, just as
I’m supposin’ it’s me to be rustlin’ another
puncher. I’m mighty glad just then, for Manuel’s
sure a first-class man on cows. He allows Gard
made him come, an’ I know nobody else ever was
able to gentle ’im in when he was up against the
impulses for a tussle with booze.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gard, he’s got me,” the foreman went on. “He
ain’t none o’ your hymn-tune kind Miss Helen; but
he ’s a right kind all right; just plain good man;
which the same ain’t common now’days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen, with Patsy beside her, was starting for
the casa.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess you’re right Sandy,” she called back,
absently, without turning around, and Sandy
looked after her with scant approval.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“There you’ve got it,” he muttered discontentedly,
to the pony, “Old an’ young they’re all alike,
the women, when it comes to sizin’ up a real man.
If it ain’t the shine an’ the pretty manners for
them, why it’s the high forehead, an’ the big idees.
I’m disappointed she don’t see that more clearly,
an’ she ridin’ herd on a college education for four
years!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He led Dickens away toward the sheds and
turned him over to one of the men.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose now”—he went on with his meditations—“She’s
fooled into thinkin’ that there side-winder
of an Ash Westcott’s the real thing. Lord!
If the right brand was on him I know what it’d
look like!” and the foreman went about his duties
with a heavy heart.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Sandy Larch was squatted on the sand,
against the wall of his shack, lacing a new
leather into the cincha-ring of his saddle, and singing
The Tune The Old Cow Died On. The ditty
was one of his favorites, but his soul was not in it
this morning and he sang as mechanically as his
fingers moved about their familiar task. It was the
morning after Gard’s loss of the packet, and he had
been out at daybreak, going over every foot of the
breaking-ground, but he could find no trace of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gosh! I’m sorry,” he muttered, testing the new
strap. “I hate to see Gard look like he did fer a
spell yesterday. If I had any idee Westcott had
that thing, whatever it was, I’d choke it out’n
him, fer a punched two-bit-piece.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned the saddle over to investigate the
other strap, taking up the burden of his song
again:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>
<img src='images/i_246a.jpg' alt='“And this is the tune fi roll doll dey Do, sung that af- ter- noon!”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>He rolled out the chorus at the top of his lungs,
as he cut loose the cincha-thongs, and had carried
the next verse to</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_246b.jpg' alt='“The farm- er had an in- quest held To see what ailed h i s—cow—”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>When a shadow fell upon the sand before him,
and he looked up to see Wing Chang.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>“Well, my Chinee friend,” he said, “Why don’t
you join in? Can’t you sing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No can.” The cook shook his head; then the
wrinkles about his slant eyes deepened, ran downward,
and met, midway of his chops, the upward
ones that started around his grinning mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Allee samee you?” He questioned, slyly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Allee samee me what?” demanded Sandy, suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sing. You catchee him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do I sing, are you askin’?” roared the foreman.
“Why you yaller heathen! Ain’t you just
bin hearin’ me sing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wing Chang’s grin intensified, and gradually
Sandy’s own visage widened genially.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take your rise,” he said, “you sure got it out’n
me then.... Look a’ here,” he added, “What
you hangin’ round here stealin’ music lessons fer?
Where you bin, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bin talkee Bloome,” Chang said. “Him wantee
coffee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Broome! What in hell’s Broome doin’ round
here this time o’ day?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The sly look deepened in Chang’s face. His
slant eyes narrowed, and lost their humorous twinkle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say him sick,” he explained. “Think mebby
Mistlee Westclott come bimeby.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>“Not this time, my wise Chink. Westcott’s
homeward bound for Tucson just about now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whafor Mistlee Glad go away?” Wing Chang
asked, ignoring the other’s statement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I d’ know, Chang.” The foreman whistled a
few notes, meditatively. The Chinaman drew nearer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whafor Bloome an’ Mistlee Westclott hatee
him so?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sandy regarded him severely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“See here, now, Chang,” he bluffed, “You think
I’m a animated booktionary work, guaranteeded to
fit all your ‘whatfors’ with ‘is whats’? Not on
your life. Ain’t I told you your job ’s cookin’?
You don’t have to break out no question-marks on
this here rancho. Sabbee dat?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wing Chang returned his intent look without
winking.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Him two allee samee hatee Mistlee Glad,” he
repeated. “Speakee ’bout him allee timee, behind
corral. Allee timee say ‘dlamn’, an’ spit, so.” He
illustrated on the desert.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Heap you know,” the foreman said, still more
severely: “you think you’re a blanked Pinkerton
detective, don’t you? Well you ain’t. Your job ’s
beans, an’ bull meat. You go makee him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He waved a hand in the direction of Chang’s
official quarters, and the Chinaman’s perennial grin
returned.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“Allee lightee,” he said, “Then you keep look see
out on Mistlee Westclott. Bimeby, he try do Mistlee
Glad dirt, I makee my bull meat off him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He walked off, his hands in his sleeves, and
Sandy Larch looked after him thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now I wonder what that Chink thinks he
knows,” he mused. “Chang ain’t no fool. He’s
<em>hip</em> to somethin’. ’T ain’t good discipline to ask
questions off’n a Chink; but I sure wish I could
see into his shiny skull.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He picked up the saddle and took it into the
shack, returning, after a moment, to stand in the
door, humming—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_249.jpg' alt='“But the cow was mad, and she tried to sing&#160;.... Thunder an’ punkins!”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>He did not realize his variation on the ordinary
version of his song. He had brought his warbling
to a sudden finish, and stood peering out at a horseman
who was riding along the edge of the farthest
corral.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a second he stepped back into the shanty,
and watched through the crack of the half-open door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure’s shootin’,” he muttered, “The Chink was
right. It <em>is</em> Westcott.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>His ear caught a low whistle that was presently
answered from quarters. Sandy remembered that
he, himself, was supposed to be at the upper range.
He would have been on his way there but for the
defect in his cincha-strap. He stopped to consider,
wondering whether he had been singing loud
enough for Broome to hear him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what comes o’ tryin’ to be a <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">prima
donna</span></i>,” he muttered. “But any way I bin still
long enough to make him think I’m gone, if he did
hear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He stepped out upon the sand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’s something sure goin’ on out yonder,”
he said, “Sandy Larch, you’re managing this here
shebang while the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">patron</span></i>’s away; why ain’t you
eligible to a box-seat?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A long row of outhouses and ranch buildings
stretched out from the foreman’s shack to the
men’s quarters, and still beyond these were two
fodder-sheds. The last of these was about half
full of hay. It stood at the very edge of the farther
corral, and Sandy noted that Westcott had
ridden up into its shade.</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman slipped off his jangling spurs, and
keeping well in the shadow of the buildings, made
his way to this shed. He went with wonderful
lightness and quickness for so big a man, and was
presently creeping among the hay bales.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Outside, Westcott sat his horse, while Broome
leaned against the wall. Guided by the sound of
their voices, Sandy worked his way along, close to
the boards, until he was directly opposite them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What makes you think you know where the
burro is?” Westcott was saying as Sandy came
within hearing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s <em>my</em> think,” was the sulky reply. “I ain’t
no way bound to tell you it, special as you say you
don’t care about sittin’ in the game.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I didn’t really say that!” There was a
curious ring of exultation in Westcott’s voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I only said,” he resumed, “that I had my own
ways of finding out things. I have; and I dare say
I could put my hands on your burro, if I needed it
in my business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A heap you could,” Broome sneered. “Mebby
you think you kin put your hands on Gard, too, if
you need ’im in your bizness. Well, mebby you
kin; an’ mebby you wouldn’t git smashed if you
tried it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Put my hands on him—” The lawyer’s voice
was thick with emotion. “I’ve got the blasted fool
between my thumb and finger now,” he said,
“When I get ready, I can smash him like <em>that</em>!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sandy Larch heard the speaker’s two palms
come together.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not while Sandy Larch is ’round, my fine liar-at-law,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>he muttered under his breath. Then he
heard Broome’s incredulous grunt.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s got you bug-house?” the cowboy asked,
and Westcott laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you want to know who this fine Mister Gabriel
Gard really is?” He sneered, and the listener
in the shed fairly held his breath to hear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you know? You said you didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I just happen to,” Westcott said, deliberately.
“And I know he could no more file on a claim, or
on anything else in this land, than that little she-ass
you seem so keen to get hold of.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because—” Westcott’s voice was vibrant with
hate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because,” he repeated, “He’s a damned state-prison
convict. That’s why not!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Inside the shed Sandy Larch’s face shone white
in the gloom. Outside there was a sound of
Broome’s hard breathing. Westcott’s statement
seemed to have deprived the cowboy of speech.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you remember Dan Lundy?” the lawyer
said, and Sandy started.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never knowed ’im,” Broome replied. “He
was a pal o’ Sandy Larch’s.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So? I didn’t know that. Then this here Gard
won’t be so thick here when Sandy knows. But he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>won’t be very thick anywhere, in the open, for that
matter.” Westcott laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This fellow’s the one who did the business for
Lundy,” he added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Killed him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Knifed him in his shack. He did three years
for it, and then broke jail.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How d’you know?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman strained his ears to listen, a look of
wondering comprehension in his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s my business,” Westcott said. “I’ve
got it down in black and white. He came up to
Blue Gulch when I was there, and Frank Arnold
came up to take him again. That was Arnold’s
last job.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He was drowned, I remember,” Broome spoke
in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Either that, or this fellow that calls himself
Gard did for him, as he did for Lundy. Arnold
was a good man. Lord! When I think the other
fellow’s hanging around here with Larch this minute—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He ain’t here;” Broome said. “He went off
yest’day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fury! Where to?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I d’ know. He rode off some time in th’ afternoon.
He’d lost somethin’ when we was workin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>out them blame cows, an’ was mighty cut up, I
heard. An’ when he couldn’t find it he went off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Skipped—blast it!” Westcott seemed to consider.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know what he lost, all right,” he went on.
“Good thing for him Sandy Larch didn’t find it.
But I’ll land him all right, too&#160;... But that
ain’t the point,” the lawyer continued. “The point
is this: He can’t hold that claim. There’s nothing
to keep us from walking in and taking possession,
if you think you can find it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet your life I can find it,” Broome swore.</p>

<p class='c008'>“First, though,” Westcott spoke again, “I want
to go up to Phoenix. I can get the noon train.
And I’m going to fix our Mister Gard—his name
was Barker in those days—as he ought to be fixed.
He won’t be out of reach so that the authorities
can’t find him, and he won’t get away this time.
Then I’ll go down to Tucson and file that claim
right. Since he’s got no legal status anyone can
do that. Then I’ll come back here and we’ll talk
about the rest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look a’ here,” Broome interrupted, “You don’t
do no filin’ till I’m erlong, or you never gits to
where the pay-streak is. You’ve gotter do some
work on it anyway, before you kin file legal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, shut up! Tell <em>me</em> what the law is?” Westcott’s
tone was brutal. “You blamed fool,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>said, “Do you think I can’t get along without
you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ain’t sech a fool’s some,” was Broome’s retort,
“I know you can’t, er you wouldn’t be here.
You want me to help find the spot, an’ you know
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s no use fighting over it,” said Westcott,
more moderately; “I was going to Tucson this afternoon;
but I’ll go up to Phoenix first. Mind
you, now,” he added, “No funny business while
I’m gone, or it’ll be a bad day for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sandy Larch heard Westcott ride away. A moment
later Broome’s step sounded, returning to
quarters.</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman waited some time before venturing
out. When he did come into the light his face
wore a strange, half-dazed expression.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well!” he finally ejaculated, “I sure got my
money’s worth that time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He walked over to one of the corrals and stood
staring with unseeing eyes at a bunch of yearlings
huddled together in a corner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The dangnation fools!”</p>

<p class='c008'>His exclamation seemed to afford him no relief;
for presently he repeated it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The dangnation fools!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should think,” he added, “that that there
Westcott person’d wanter kick himself fer a sunbaked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>’dobe ape, when he finds out what he’s
bound to find out, when he gets askin’ questions
along o’ Phoenix.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The plumb fool,” he said, again. “To think he
don’t know Jim Texas confessed to killin’ Dan.
The pizen-snake always said he would, an’ poor
old Dan was mighty foolhardy about it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, God!”—his tone was full of pity—“To
think that ‘Gard’ was that poor devil of a Barker!
How in tunk did he ever git where he is now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He picked up a bit of stone and flung it at the
yearlings; not because he bore them a grudge, but
through sheer vexation of spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If he’d only a’ told me,” his thoughts went
back to Gard. “If he’d only a’ trusted me, ’stid
o’ writin’ it out fer that hell-dog to find.” He
leaned upon the top-rail of the corral and sighed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord,” he said, “I’m pretty near all in. It’s
too much fer Sandy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He could not understand Gard’s agitation over
the loss of his packet, if, as he now surmised, it
merely contained the papers by which Westcott had
identified him. He pondered the matter for some
time, and then light dawned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look a’ here!” he cried. “He’s in the same
boat’s Westcott! He’s bin up in the mountains
ever since he made his getaway; that’s what! Fer
some reason or other he’s just come down, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>wondered where in tunk he’d drifted in from.
An’ he ain’t found out yet about Jim Texas.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Silence again, while Sandy meditated upon the
situation. Then another phase of it struck him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s he doin’ round here, anyway? Why
ain’t he showin’ some enterprise? What’s he
hangin’ round Kate Hallard for?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He could not tell. It was the one thing about
Gard that to him seemed to need explanation, and
he would trust his friend without that. He was
dismissing the matter when a fresh thought came.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If he <em>don’t</em> know,” he muttered. “If he ain’t
fixed his matters up, then that sneakin’ law-buzzard’s
right. He can’t file any claim. They can
<em>do</em> him, there; even if they can’t jail ’im. By the
powers! That’s what they can do; an’ here I am,
can’t leave the rancho!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He groaned as this thought came home to him.
He realized that he must stay at the Palo Verde:
Morgan Anderson had left him in charge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If ’twant fer leavin’ the little gal all alone—”
He stood distractedly considering.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know enough about it anyway,” he at
last exclaimed in despair. “Ah! That’s where
Kate Hallard comes in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The words were scarcely off his lips when looking
up, he gave a low whistle of surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure ’s beeswax,” he said, softly, unconsciously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>straightening up. “Here’s exactly where Kate
Hallard comes in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was in fact Mrs. Hallard, riding in from the
desert, her handsome face more troubled in expression
than Sandy had ever imagined it could be.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello, Kate,” he called, going to meet her.
“What’s up? You don’t look like you was out fer
your health so to speak.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ain’t.” Mrs. Hallard drew rein and looked
down at the foreman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ain’t out fer my health an’ I ain’t sure what
I be out after,” she said, without further preamble.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ash Westcott was in t’ the grille this morning
tryin’ to make a deal with me in a matter Mr.
Gard’s been tendin’ to fer me. I wouldn’t swap
no lies with him and bimeby he gets mad an’ runs
off a lot o’ talk I don’t seem to get straight, but it
sounded like he had Gard nailed, an’ was goin’ to
do ’im dirt. Sure’s you live, Sandy, he’s meanin’
mischief. I’m worried.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned her horse toward the shade, Sandy
walking beside her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I d’ know what to do,” she continued. “Mr.
Gard, he’s gone off on business o’ mine an’ I
d’ know what Westcott <em>is</em> cookin’ up against him.
I know he’s got a good-will to do him all the
harm he can, though, an’ I come over to talk to
you about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>The cow-puncher stood regarding her, intently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kate,” he said, “do you know who this Gabriel
Gard really is?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at him blankly, her hard face set.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t need stand me off,” he cried. “If
you’re his friend you know I am, too. An’ he’s
sure needin’ us both.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He told her, with picturesque brevity, of Gard’s
loss and Westcott’s find, and of the talk which he
had overheard between Westcott and Broome.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Them blamed sneakin’ coyotes is puttin’ up a
cinch game on our man,” he said, when he had
finished, “an’ something’s gotter be done about it.
Where’s Gard gone? Is that his real name? Why
ain’t he lookin’ after his matters?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Hallard was thinking fast. Sandy’s story
had been illuminating in many ways.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re dead right about one thing, Sandy,”
she said. “He don’t know about Jim Texas.
That’s what’s bin eatin’ ’im.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She suddenly realized the significance of Gard’s
answer to her question about Helen Anderson.
He did not know that his innocence was practically
established.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” Sandy demanded, “what in thunder’s
he doin’ round here then? Why ain’t he tryin’ to
fix things up fer himself? He’s got a’ plenty
cash. He ought to be gittin’ a good lawyer an’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>seein’ if he can’t prove his innercence. As ’tis
now, he must think he’s likely to be jugged any
minit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Kate Hallard’s eyes flashed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He <em>does</em> think so,” she cried. “He’s afraid of
it, too. That I know. An’ bein’ afraid, here’s
what the man does.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She leaned from the saddle and looked Sandy in
the eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He somehow gits hold of a deed o’ Sam Hallard’s,
to that Modesta range Sam bought just
’fore he was killed. I give that deed to Arnold to
record, an’ Mr. Gard ain’t said nothin’ to me, but
I figure he an’ Arnold was together when the
cloudburst come that gits Arnold. He got Frank’s
coat, someway, an’ that deed was in the pocket.
I d’ know where he’s bin all this time, but I know
one thing. He ain’t bin in no wickedness.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bet your life not,” Sandy assented. “Drive
erlong, Kate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well: the deed’s bin lost these two years, an’
that devil, Westcott, he found it out, an’ he done
me out’n the prop’ty. Oh! He’s a side-winder,
fer sure!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s no lie,” was Sandy’s comment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s plain ’s day,” Mrs. Hallard went on.
“You say he’s got a’ plenty cash. <em>I</em> know he
could light out from here an’ go where he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>live like a lord. He’s got that much a’ plenty.
But ’stid o’ that he comes back here to this God-forsaken
place; an’ what for? Why to help me.
He must a’ tracked over half the territory to find
me an’ gimme back that deed; an’ when he finds
how things stands he settles down here to see I
git my rights. With this thing a’ hangin’ over
him, so far’s he knows, he’s gone back where he
was known, to try ’n’ find a feller that witnessed
the transfer....”</p>

<p class='c008'>Kate Hallard was all but sobbing with excitement
and fear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord above us,—if they is any!” she gasped.
“They ain’t never a man like that. He’s pure
angel!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Naw; he ain’t that, quite,” Sandy said, swallowing
hard. “He’s man enough to need that
gold-mine in his business, one o’ these days, an’ he
stands to git robbed o’ that, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How can they touch it? He’s an innercent
man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes; but he’s a criminal yet, in the eyes o’ the
law, if he ain’t bin pardoned an’ cleared. So his
notice an’ filin’ ain’t legal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hell!” he exclaimed, and begged pardon next
instant. “I wish I was in Prescott,” he added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What would you do in Prescott?” Mrs. Hallard
asked, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>“Do? I’d see the Gov’nor; git them papers
made out, an’ scoot fer Tucson an’ bring that there
filin’ up to date.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Heavens an’ earth! Kin anybody do that fer
’im?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then look here, Sandy Larch: <em>I’m</em> goin’ to
Prescott.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, me; why not? You say anybody kin see
the Gov’nor fer ’im. Well: they ain’t many people
knows Dave Marden much better ’n I did once.
I rather reckon he’d do ’s much fer me ’s fer
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a deeper hue in the speaker’s cheek
than even excitement had touched it to: but the
foreman did not notice it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bully fer you Kate!” he cried. “I’m inclined
to think well o’ that scheme o’ your’n.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll have to hustle if I’m goin’ to git away
to-day.” Mrs. Hallard was practical and alert at
once. “I guess I can skip back an’ git ready to
catch the night train. That’ll get me to Prescott
in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Westcott, he’s just gone up on the noon run,”
Sandy explained. “He’ll be goin’ on to Phoenix
I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord! I don’t wanter see him. I’m glad I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>couldn’t get that train if I tried.” Mrs. Hallard
was already riding away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So long, Sandy!” she cried, over her shoulder.
“I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good luck to you!” Sandy waved his big cowboy
hat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kate’ll fetch it I reckon,” he muttered, turning
toward the sheds. “But now who’d a’ thunk
we’d a’ fixed it up that a’way? Gosh-hemlock!
What funny things you see when you ain’t got a
gun!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Kate Hallard, meantime, was thinking of many
things as she rode back to Sylvania. The tide of
old memories was at flood as she thought of the
man whom she was going to see in Gard’s behalf.
She had spoken truly when she told Sandy Larch
she had once known the Governor well. How
well, was a matter that lay deep in her heart, a
part of her hard, sordid, unprotected girlhood,
dead and buried now these thousand years, it
seemed to her. Something within her that she had
thought was dead with it shrank from the encounter
of the morrow, but cowardice was not one
of the woman’s weaknesses. She set her shoulders
squarely at the memory of what Gard was braving
for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’s one thing sure,” she said, half aloud.
“Dave’ll do anything <em>can</em> be done. I reckon I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>can bank on that. He wa’ n’t a bad sort in the old
days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The road ran along the edge of an ancient
lake, now a sea of sand, and for many years, in
the new order, the great rodeo ground of the
region. The entrance was yet marked by two big
posts, one of which bore a great yellow-and-black
poster, such as the Salvation Army puts up through
the desert wastes, seeking to turn the plainsman’s
thoughts to higher things.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beneath the poster, on the sand, a bull-snake and
a burrowing owl fraternized comfortably at the
mouth of the hole that was their common dwelling.
Above it a carrion crow perched, cawing
dismally at the scene. The poster itself was sun-bleached
and weather-worn, peppered with the
bullets of passing cowboys who had taken jocular
shots at it, and beaten by the blown desert-sand,
but still legible. Kate Hallard had seen many of
its kind; had passed this very one on her way out
that morning. She glanced at it now.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD
THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY-BEGOTTEN
SON, THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH
ON HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH—</em>” The
rest was obliterated.</p>

<p class='c008'>In her softened mood the words held her attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>as they had never before done. She checked
her horse to read them again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I d’ know much about it,” she murmured. “The
desert’s always been a mighty handy place fer
perishin’; if they <em>was</em> a God, now, an’ He was
int’rested enough to give us a few more folks like
this here Gabriel Gard, I guess mebby believin’ ’d
come handier, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She rode on again, still thinking of Gard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve got to help him out o’ this.” A dull
flush crept up to her hair and her black eyes suddenly
filled with unfamiliar tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go to Dave Marden fer him—” she cried,
“Lord! I’d go to the Old Nick himself to help
him, an’ that’s the truth!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>“Upon my word, Kate! Upon my word: this is
the biggest surprise I’ve had since I came
down with the mumps last New Year’s!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Governor of Arizona sprang up from his
big desk chair and crossed the room as Mrs. Hallard
came into his private office. His manner was
cordial, the more so, perhaps, that it was tinged
with a nervousness of which he was uneasily
aware. If Mrs. Hallard was aware of this nervousness,
she made no sign. Her own manner was
strangely quiet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s the biggest kind of a surprise,” the Governor
said, again. “I could hardly believe it when
they brought in your name.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He established his visitor in a big arm-chair, and
seated himself opposite her, his face a little in the
shadow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why,” said he, “I haven’t seen you, Kate,
since—” He paused, abruptly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a long time since you seen me, Dave; that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>’s straight,” Mrs. Hallard said, “But I’m mighty
glad you ain’t fergot me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Forgotten you!” Governor Marden’s tone was
reproachful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think ten years is enough to forget
friends in?” he demanded. “Why—” with a
laugh,—“even a political memory’s longer than
that, Kate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was silence for a moment, and silence was
the last thing the Governor desired at that time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never heard where you went after Ed’s
death,” he said, tentatively.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You wouldn’t a’ bin likely to,” was the reply.
“I moved round considerable after that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So? How’s the world used you, on the
whole? Pretty prosperous?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Up an’ down. I ain’t so awful prosperous; but
I ain’t complainin’ neither. I’m alive, an’ what I
am, workin’ fer my livin’ an’ neither better nor
worse ’n some other folks.” Mrs. Hallard spoke
lightly, and her tone was non-committal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll bet you aren’t any worse than other folks,”
the Governor said, with bluff good-will. “You
were always better than ninety-nine hundredths of
the men, Kate,” he added, “while as for the
women—”</p>

<p class='c008'>Kate Hallard interrupted him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you bother about them, Dave,” said she,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>“I ain’t matchin’ myself up with no women. It
don’t pay.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She laughed, a hard little sound, and a dull flush
went up to the Governor’s hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You might, for a fact, though, my girl,” he
persisted, half sullenly. “There’s lots of women
with straight-laced ideas that I wouldn’t trust half
so quick. Unlace their ideas a little and they’d go
to the devil so quick you’d never catch ’em. The
lacing’s all that holds them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Hallard made no reply; her companion sat
regarding her, but seeing, instead of the woman
before him, the quick, handsome girl of a dozen
years earlier. Old “Soaker” Lally’s daughter had
been in her teens when first he knew her, handsome
as they made ’em, he thought, now, remembering.
And he had been a young fool—and worse—but
not wholly a villain; not that.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I’d have made things right, Kate, if you
hadn’t sent me off,” he said, lamely, speaking out
of old memories.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” the woman flashed, “an’ we’d a’ had a
nice little hell all to ourselves, after.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man demurred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes we would!” she went on, “<em>I</em> know. First
place, Dave—I didn’t sense it then, but I have
since—we didn’t neither of us really care. We
was only hot-blooded young fools that thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>we did.... Anyhow: it’s sleepin’ dogs now,” she
added, conclusively. “Best let ’em lie. You done
more ’n most men would, I’ll say that much, when
you wanted to marry me—but I saved you that,
anyhow,” with another laugh; “I’d a’ looked
sweet, wouldn’t I? tryin’ to make good as Governor’s
lady?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’d make good at anything you undertook,
Kate,” Marden insisted, sturdily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe so: but thank my stars I know, yet,
when I ain’t got the hand to stack up on. What a
man wants in a wife, Dave, is a woman ’t can
chaperon his daughter when he gits one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Hallard hesitated a moment, her voice
softening. “I never had no watchin’ over, myself,”
she said, “I wouldn’t a’ stood fer’t from
the old man, an’ my mother died when I was a kid;
but a girl needs it: an’ it takes the right sort o’
woman to give it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s nothing here nor there, though,” she
went on, in her wonted tone; “Ed Hallard married
me with his eyes open, an’ I was a good straight
wife to ’im.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s just what I say,” Marden repeated.
“I’d back you to be a good straight anything you
undertook. That’s your nature. I’m not passing
you any bouquets, my girl. You were always as
straight as a man.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>Mrs. Hallard laughed, with cynical good humor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord, sonny!” she cried. “If them ain’t bouquets,
be a little easy with whatever ’t is you do
call ’em. Admirin’ the men as I do, such is some
overpowerin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Governor Marden flushed again, and edged
away from ground that he felt to be precarious.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here,” he said, “What do you mean by
saying you’re working for your living? Is that
a figure of speech? Ed Hallard ought to have left
you well fixed. I heard he sold that claim of his
for a good round sum. Didn’t he do right by you,
Kate?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He meant to. He thought he did. I’ll tell
you about that later.” Mrs. Hallard waved a hand
in careless dismissal of her own matters.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dave,” she began, earnestly, “I want a favor
off you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Governor Marden was alert in an instant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anything I can do for you, ‘for old sake’s
sake,’” he answered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This ain’t any old sake’s sake,” was her answer.
“It’s just fair play an’ justice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! That’s different. Fair play and justice
are complicated things to meddle with.” The
governor shook his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet I’m learnin’ that,” was Mrs. Hallard’s
reply. “But they ain’t nothin’ much complicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>about this business. It oughter be plain cuttin’ out
an’ ridin’ off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Were n’t you District Attorney when Dan
Lundy was killed, Dave?” she asked, suddenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The governor started, glancing quickly at his
interrogator. Then he was silent for a moment,
staring thoughtfully at a map of Arizona on the
wall back of Mrs. Hallard’s chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord; that’s what I was!” he finally said with
a sigh. “I don’t like to talk about it,” he added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“From your bringing the matter up I guess you
know why not,” Marden frowned, as over some
painful memory. “I reckon you’ve got some idea
how it was,” he continued. “I did my duty as I
saw it; but we bagged the wrong man, and I’ve
never been able to feel happy about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then it was true about Jim Texas confessin’?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. He confessed when he was dying, but it
didn’t do the other poor fellow any good. He
was dead already.” The governor sighed again....
“I told you justice and fair play were ticklish
things to handle,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But he ain’t dead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who ain’t?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The other fellow. He wasn’t killed when
Frank Arnold was.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Governor Marden sat silent, his eyes questioning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>his visitor. Kate Hallard explained, briefly. The
governor touched a bell, and his secretary appeared.
The latter had been Marden’s clerk in his
district attorney days.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Seth,” the official said, in a voice that rang
with suppressed excitement. “You remember the
Lundy case, don’t you? Whatever became of
Barker, who went up for it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The secretary considered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, yes,” he began, “he broke jail.” His
auditors nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I remember about it,” he went on, “because of
Jim Texas, and what came after. He got away
to some place in the mountains, and then he was
re-arrested. A deputy-sheriff went down on information
from Ash Westcott—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?” Mrs. Hallard’s tone was explosive.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who d’you say?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ashley Westcott,” the secretary repeated.
“He’s—”</p>

<p class='c008'>Kate Hallard interrupted again, her eyes blazing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know who he is,” she flashed. “He’s the
same cur-dog that’s tryin’ to down ’im again.
He’s the same—oh, D—Governor Marden, you
was askin’ why Ed Hallard didn’t leave me better
fixed. Well: here’s why—”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>The story came pouring out at white heat, while
the two men listened, now and then exchanging
significant glances.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the name of heaven, Kate,” the governor
said, when Mrs. Hallard paused for breath, “why
didn’t you come and tell me of this deviltry?
We’d have stopped Westcott’s game so quick
he’d never have known he chipped into it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t know any better,” the woman said,
bitterly. “I don’t know as I’d a’ come here with
it; but if I hadn’t bin an ignorant fool I’d a’
knowed I could do something; but I never did till
Mr. Gard told me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You say this chap calls himself Gard? Is that
his real name, or Barker? What makes you think
he’s the same man?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only what Westcott said—that Sandy Larch
heard. He must a’ found something that put ’im
wise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It looks that way,” the governor said. “Westcott’s
no fool, knave though he is. And do you
know, Kate—he’s laying his lines to be the next
District Attorney! It looked, till you came in and
told us this, as if he’d led his line clean to Washington.
Didn’t it, Seth?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The secretary gave a grunt. Governor Marden
turned again to Mrs. Hallard. “We’ll meet his
game this time,” he said. “See him and go him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>about a thousand better. You’ve done me a big
favor, Kate. What’s the one you want done?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want Mr. Gard’s pardon fixed up,” his visitor
said, promptly. “That’s what I come for. I
want the papers fixed up right, an’ then I wanter
know if they ain’t some way to put a cinch on that
there claim.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure there is,” was the reply. “The pardon’s
dead easy; only it’ll have to be Barker’s pardon.
Seth, you fix up the papers will you, and I’ll sign
right off.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Glory be!” The governor heaved a mighty
sigh as the secretary went back to his own room.
He got up and took a turn about the office, throwing
back his shoulders with an air of relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That thing’s weighed on me,” he exclaimed.
“You don’t know what mistakes like that mean to
a man. It’s been a dead weight, sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned, quickly, and took down a volume of
mining-law.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose,” he said, after pouring over its pages
for some moments, “yes, I guess Westcott <em>could</em> do
something about that. I don’t know as he’d dare
try, when he finds out the truth, but it’s best not to
take any risks with a ‘sarpint’ like that, and I’m
going to have Unricht go down to Tucson with
you, Kate, and fix the whole matter right. There’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>time enough to get a night train if you want to—”
He looked at his watch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s just what I do,” she replied, promptly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, then.” The governor turned. Unricht
had come in with a document ready for the
official signature.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wasn’t sure,” the secretary said, “so I stopped
to look it up in the testimony. Maybe you remember,
Governor,” he went on, “that Barker claimed
at the trial that he had retained Westcott and paid
him a big fee. He hadn’t any more money to pay
a lawyer; so the court appointed him one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The governor was signing the paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By gum!” he exclaimed, looking up, “I do seem
to remember. Sounded like a cock-and-bull story
then. Westcott had left town, you know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But say, friends:” he straightened up and
looked from one to the other of his auditors,—“the
desert’s got a beauteous lot of poison citizens,”
he said, “what with tarantulas, and sidewinders,
and ground-rattlers, and Gila monsters,
and hydrophobia skunks; but it don’t breed anything
more poisonous than a man, when he <em>is</em>
poison.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He threw down his pen and handed the paper
he had signed to Mrs. Hallard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s done,” he said, gleefully. “Unricht,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>can you fix it to go down to Tucson to-night, and
do a little business for me to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The secretary consulted his calendar and decided
that he could arrange for the expedition. It was
agreed that Mrs. Hallard and he should meet at
the station in time for the evening train. “About
that matter of your own, Kate,” the governor said,
as Mrs. Hallard was leaving, “I shouldn’t wonder
if your Mr. Barker-Gard was equal to fixing Westcott;
but if either of you need any help you call
on David Marden. Now don’t you forget!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Unricht and Mrs. Hallard went straight to the
proper office, on their arrival in Tucson next morning,
and the secretary saw to it that Gard’s claim
was correctly refiled, and the matter put in unassailable
shape. This done, they sought the St. Augustine,
where Kate was to wait for the forenoon
train to Bonesta.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll have to leave you a little while before it
goes,” Unricht was saying, as they stood in what
had been the vestibule of the old church. “My
own train is earlier—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sh—hush—”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Hallard drew her companion back into the
slender shelter of a great pillar. “Look over
there,” she whispered, and Unricht glanced in the
direction indicated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott had just come into the building and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>stepped up to the desk. He was making some inquiry
about the next train south, and the watchers
had a good look at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>His face was livid, and drawn into an expression
of concentrated rage. He looked like a venomous
creature of the desert, and as he crossed the office
and ascended the two or three steps to the great
dining-room, his step was wavering and uncertain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And he don’t drink,” Unricht whispered to Mrs.
Hallard. “I know that. He’s just drunk with rage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I don’t wanter go down on the same train
with him,” Mrs. Hallard whispered back. “I
should be scared o’ my life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Unricht reassured her. “He wouldn’t really
hurt you,” he said, “but I don’t blame you for
wanting to dodge him. I shouldn’t wonder if he
was going down to see you, though. He must
know he’s in a pretty pickle if he can’t make
terms with you. Maybe you’d better see him
now, while I’m along,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Hallard demurred. “I’d rather get home,”
she said. “Mr. Gard may be there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” was the reply. “I’ll telephone
Larch you’re getting the afternoon train.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They slipped out and went to another hotel,
thereby missing Gard, who presently came in from
up the territory, eager to get back to Sylvania, and
report to Mrs. Hallard.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XI</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Westcott’s state of mind, miserable as it
was, would have been more unenviable still
had he known that Gard was on the train with him
during the journey to Bonesta. The lawyer was
hurrying to Sylvania to secure another interview
with Kate Hallard in the absence of her champion.
He reasoned that she could not yet have heard
from Gard, whose quest in the north, he surmised,
had something to do with her business.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was still puzzled to understand why a man
like Gard should have prepared such a statement as
was contained in the packet which he had found on
the desert. In the light of what he himself had
just learned, it seemed as if he must have known
that it was unnecessary. The paper bore no date,
and he finally concluded that it must have been
written at some time before Gard had learned of
Jim Texas’ confession. Westcott himself had not
known of this before going north on this trip. He
had been willing to forget the whole business once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>he was sure that Barker had disappeared forever.
Now he was in a white rage at the position in which
he found himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had been in too great haste, after learning
the facts of Gard’s innocence, to think further of
the mining claim. When Mrs. Hallard and Unricht
saw him in the St. Augustine he had just
come in from the north. He spent no time in
Tucson, looking up records which he took for
granted Gard had already made right. He was
sure that the latter’s first act upon returning to civilization
would be to put his own affairs into secure
shape. Only in some such way was it possible for
a mind like Westcott’s to understand a man’s willingly
remaining in a position which must otherwise
seem to him perilous, for the sake of seeing right
done to a woman like Mrs. Hallard. He realized,
too, with a horrible sense of being trapped, that he
himself was in Gard’s power.</p>

<p class='c008'>How that power would be used he felt no doubt.
The man was probably only making sure of his
ground. He would have his case clear before he
struck, and no one knew, better than Ashley Westcott,
how clear that case could be made. He had
reckoned absolutely upon the loss of that deed, and
upon Kate Hallard’s helplessness and ignorance;
and the stolen property now stood on record in his
own name.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>The sweat started upon his forehead as he told
over in his mind the motives that would inevitably
impel a man in Gard’s position to seek revenge
upon him. No wonder the fellow had taken this
business up. No wonder he had not been tempted
to make a deal with him. Westcott flinched inwardly,
as he remembered his own fatuous proposition
that morning at the Palo Verde. How
Gard must have been laughing at him, behind that
grave face. The matter stood out before him in
the fierce light of his own hatred; he could conceive
of no other feeling actuating his enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Any way he looked at it, the man was bound to
be meditating his ruin. Through the whirl of
Westcott’s thoughts ran but one slender thread of
hope. If he could see Kate Hallard he might
effect a compromise with her. When last he saw
her he had been sure that he had Gard in his power.
He had boasted to her that he meant to crush the
fellow; to show her what a helpless creature she
had trusted. She had laughed at his threats, but
there had been anxiety under her laughter. He had
seen that as he departed, exulting. Perhaps he
could work that line with her again. He would
see; he <em>must</em> see!</p>

<p class='c008'>If he could not arrange with her there was
nothing for him to do but to run for it. He might
be able to realize on the property before getting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>away; a cattleman up north was even then considering
its purchase. In any case, Kate Hallard
failing him, he must get out of Arizona; get out of
the country, even, if Gard’s hatred still pursued
him. To stay, after this, spelled jail.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the word Gard’s face came up before him as
it had looked that night in Blue Gulch, and the
horror of it set him shivering. Remorse was no
part of his emotion; he felt only a sense of impotent
regret at the shattering of his plans, and a
blind hatred of Gard as the cause of his undoing.
He cursed him in his heart as he sat staring out
upon the desert landscape slipping past the car
window.</p>

<p class='c008'>Its desolation added to his horror, and his fury.
It was a hellish place, working its own infernal
way with men whom fate forced to dwell in it; but
he had worked, and planned, and striven there; he
had seen his dear ambition coming within reach of
his hand. Now he saw himself hunted like a jack-rabbit
from the scene of all his hopes and desires.</p>

<p class='c008'>And there was Helen. He believed that he had
stood a chance there. And he had meant, once he
was out of this snarl, to live straight. With her to
help him he could go far. Arizona would be a
state some day. There were big possibilities ahead.
He writhed in his seat at the thought, and cursed
Gabriel Gard anew for plotting his downfall.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>The horse that he had ridden to Bonesta several
days before had been sent back to Sylvania; so
Westcott went up to the outfitting town in the tri-weekly
stage which was waiting at the train. This
fact enabled Gard the better to keep out of the
lawyer’s sight. His own horse was in the Bonesta
stable.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was no more anxious to encounter Westcott
than the latter was to meet him. He had seen him
at the Tucson station in time to seek another car
from the one in which the attorney seated himself,
and now he had but to keep out of view until the
lumbering stage swung up the road with his foe on
board.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard had found his man, and had in his pocket
Sawyer’s affidavit to having taken the acknowledgment
of the Hallard deed. He had learned,
too, that this deed ante-dated the one of record to
Westcott’s client. This personage, he had ascertained,
was a mere tool of the attorney’s. The
actual holder of the property was Westcott himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was greatly troubled, on arriving at Sylvania,
to find that Mrs. Hallard had gone away.
He tortured his mind for an explanation of her
sudden journey. He was afraid that she had been
again misled by Westcott. If the lawyer really
<em>had</em> found that lost packet there was no predicting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>the uses to which he might put it in making representations
to Mrs. Hallard.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sing Fat could give him no information beyond
the fact that Mrs. Hallard had ridden out to the
Palo Verde, returning in “one velly big hully-up,”
to prepare for a journey to Prescott. He could not
tell when she would return.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard pondered the matter in sorry perplexity.
He could not fathom the mystery, but he feared—everything.
He dreaded what might have taken
place at the Palo Verde. What had taken Mrs.
Hallard there? What had Sandy Larch been told?
What did Miss Anderson believe?</p>

<p class='c008'>The last was the question of his deepest thought.
He was not fearful for himself, of anything that
might come. The doubts and the temptations of
the situation had all been settled in his mind. He
had learned stern lessons in solitude, and he
brought them sternly to bear in this exigency. This
thing had been given to him, Gabriel Gard, to
carry through. Whatever might come to him as
one human being did not count. It was the life of
the world that counted, and to see justice done was
just now, for him, a part of that life. If payment
seemed to fall upon him, who was he, that he
could not bear his burden? Neither his courage
nor his purpose faltered before the outlook.</p>

<p class='c008'>But that Helen Anderson should believe of him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>the things he was sure that Westcott would try to
make her believe, was more than his reason told
him need be borne. The mastering desire of his
soul at this moment was that she should believe in
him; that she should know the truth from his own
lips before she judged him. The vague plan that
had suggested itself to him on the way up now
took definite shape. He resolved to ride out to
the Palo Verde; to see Helen if possible, and get
her to listen to the whole story. She should believe
him, if there was any power in truth to make
its impress upon a true nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She <em>is</em> true,” he told himself, recalling her clear,
candid eyes, her fine, fearless spirit. “She will
believe me. She must believe me. Oh, God, help
me <em>make</em> her believe me! It’s all I ask!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He had no intention of putting his fate to further
test. When he should be free; able to hold up
his head without shame among men; then the
right to speak would be his. Then he would lay
his life at her feet. It was hers. But now, he
would have given his last drop of blood just to
know that she knew, and that she believed him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He left Mrs. Hallard’s papers, securely sealed,
in Sing Fat’s care, seeing them put in a place of
safety before he turned away to where he had put
up his horse.</p>

<p class='c008'>The animal was still feeding; for himself Gard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>had forgotten the need of food. He hesitated, loth
to take the creature out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Goin’ far?” the stable man asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Out to the Palo Verde,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better take one o’ our broncs, then,” the man
jerked a thumb in the direction of a flea-bitten
roan standing in its stall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That un’ll take you out there all right,” he
said, “tho’ he ain’t no shucks of a goer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll do,” and the roan was brought out and
saddled. A man who had slunk from the stable
when Gard came in lingered unseen at the head of
the alley to see him ride away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gwan,” he jeered in drunken exultation as
horse and rider passed up the street; “go it while
ye can; yer time’s a comin’ my fine, pious jail-bird.
Here’s where yer wings is goin’ to be
clipped sure’s my name’s Thad Broome!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The cow-puncher had come into town breathing
out wrath against Sandy Larch, with whom he had
had words. He was foregathering with certain
chosen companions, and had already succeeded in
getting well on the road to drunkenness. He was
headed for Jim Bracton’s with his friends when
the quartette met Westcott, fresh from an effort to
pump Sing Fat regarding Mrs. Hallard’s whereabouts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sing Fat had been non-committal. He knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>that the lawyer was not in the good graces of his
mistress, and so, being a Chinaman, he had little
that was definite to tell him. Westcott was in a
white rage when he was hailed by Broome, too
drunk now to be discreet.</p>

<p class='c008'>He answered the cow-puncher’s surprised greeting
shortly, but Broome was not to be put off. He
was in a condition to attach importance to his own
personality, and he followed Westcott, who was
walking away from the town, too furious to endure
contact with humanity. The puncher’s companions
trailed after.</p>

<p class='c008'>Out beyond the edge of the settlement the lawyer
turned, enraged.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What in hell are you following me for,
Broome?” he snapped, savagely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wanter word wi’ you, Misher Weshcott,” the
fellow said, thickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What about? Why aren’t you on the range?
What are you hanging around here for?” The
questions followed one another with a jerk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Broome burst into a tirade of profanity, the
burden of which was that he would take no bossing
from Sandy Larch. He had defied the latter and
had been given his time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you got yourself fired,” Westcott commented
in a slow rage. “You’re an even bigger
blasted fool than I thought you could be.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Broome blustered, drunkenly. Did Westcott
think he was going to stand any lip from Sandy
Larch when he had a fortune in sight?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fortune—hell!” Westcott’s fury broke bounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What you’ve got in sight,” he said, hoarsely,
“is an asylum for damned fools; or else a hemp
necktie and a short drop. One or the other’s yours
all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The cow-puncher stared, stupidly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gwan,” he said, “Whatcher givin’ us? Gard
ain’t made no drift; he’s just now gone out to the
Palo Verde; I seen ’im.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott was startled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What has he gone out there for?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How ’n hell do I know,” was the reply. “When
we goin’ t’ land ’im?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shut up!” Westcott almost screamed the words
in the intensity of his nervous pain. “You can’t
touch Gard, you blasted donkey,” he added; “he’s
made himself solid with the law. He’s pardoned
all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pardoned!” Broome’s jaw dropped. “Did he
bring away enough fer that in them two bags?” he
gasped.</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott made no reply and the cow-puncher
turned to his fellows.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>“Now wha’ d’ye think o’ that?” he roared,
“You know this here Gard, Jim. He’s that dod-gasted
sawney that butted in when you was teachin’
old Joe Papago the things he most needed to know
that night up to the ‘Happy Family.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess I know ’im all right, damn ’im,”
snarled the one addressed. “He done me out ’n a
good thing that time. I stood to win—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Done ye! Call that doin’ ye?” Broome
snarled. “He done me out ’n more ’n he did you.
Thousands o’ dollars he’s robbed me of.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aw, pull ’er in easy Broome,” interrupted one
of the others, coming close. “You never had a
thousand in yer life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ye lie! I had my eyes on the richest vein in
Arizona, an’ this feller lit on me an’ nearly killed
me when he found I’d seen it. He chased me
out ’n it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d pot any man tried that on me,” the other
said. “Where in tunk was yer gun?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where ’t is now,” Broome growled, “an’
that’s none o’ your business. I’ll git ’im yet.
He’s a murderer an’ a thief, an’ I’ll git ’im yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An’ hang for it.” This man spoke for the first
time. “He ain’t worth it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not on your life would I hang fer ’t,” was
Broome’s reply. “I tell ye the man’s a murderer
an’ a thief anyhow; an’ as fer his bein’ worth it, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>tell ye that claim he’s hanging onto’s got a million
in plain sight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An’ to think of it,” he went on, dolorously,
“that I had my two hands on them bags, an’ hefted
’em, an’ saw their color.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pity you didn’t smell of them while you were
about it,” sneered Westcott. “It’s about all the
good you’ll ever get of the stuff.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it, eh,” Broome turned on him in maudlin rage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s all I’ll ever git with any help o’ your’n,”
he raged, “but I kin do a thing er two yet, off ’n
my own bat. By God! Just you lemme git my
two hands on the feller ’n I’ll twist his windpipe
good ’n’ plenty!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He gasped for breath, tearing at the band of his
shirt.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll kill ’im,” he swore. “D’ye think I’ll let
’im live when he’s took the bread out o’ my mouth
like he done?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott regarded him with narrowed eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’d be a blasted fool to stand it,” he said,
speaking very low, “any set of men are fools to
let another man ride over them; but they’re bigger
fools if they don’t keep their mouths shut.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s so,” one of the men commented. “You
fellers wanter look out. This here Gard you’re
talkin’ about’s a stranger to me, an’ I d’ know all
he’s done, but such talk’s plumb dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>He shook his head with drunken gravity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wha’d you wanter kill ’im for?” he asked of
Broome.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tell ye he’s a damned murderer,” was the
reply. “He’d oughter be killed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that right?” The man who did not know
Gard turned to Westcott with a profoundly judicial
air.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why ain’t he hung then?” he went on. “How
d’you know he’s guilty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Westcott hesitated, considering. He did not
look at the questioner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I saw the whole story written out in his own
hand,” he finally said, with a curious glitter in his
half-veiled eyes. “I’ve just been up north trying
to have him arrested,” he continued. “Broome
here knows that; but I found the matter’d been
patched up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hell! That ain’t no ways right.” The speaker
steadied himself, and regarded the lawyer severely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They ain’t no justice in that,” he resumed.
“Murder’s murder; an’ the punishment for murder’s
hanging. I d’mand t’ know why he ain’t
hung?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll have to answer your own question,” was
the quiet reply. “What are you going to do about
that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know what I’d do about it,” Broome spoke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>this time. “I’d hang ’im myself, quick’s that,”
snapping his fingers, “if I got the chance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lynching’s gone out of style,” sneered Westcott.
“We’re law-abiding in Arizona now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Law be damned,” Broome blustered. “Lynching’s
too good fer ’im; but it’d serve, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The word passed from one to another of the
drunken group. The men looked at one another,
and fell into a confused discussion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you say you saw that there confession in
his own handwrite?” the stranger presently turned
to ask of Westcott, but the lawyer had already
hurried away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you worry none about that,” Broome
answered for him, with an oath. “I tell ye, Hickey,
I know what I’m talkin’ about. The man’s an
escaped jail-bird that was in fer murder. He’s
dodged the law, but hell! he ain’t dodged Thad
Broome yet!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The talk went on among the men, but Westcott
was not there to hear it. He had seen to it that he
should not be, and was well on his way back to town.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had not put the idea into their heads, he told
himself. Nor was it likely that anything would
come of their drunken vaporings.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if anything should—His heart was beating
excitedly, and his breath came quick as the possibilities
of the situation hammered at his brain.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“Curse the fellow,” he muttered. “The very
devil himself is always sending him my way. Well,
whatever happens to him this trip he’s brought it
upon himself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He walked on, his thoughts growing more
definite.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing can be proved against me,” they ran.
“I can’t be supposed to know what a lot of drunken
punchers are likely to do. The fool ought to have
been careful how he interfered with them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Still, if anything <em>should</em> happen,” caution suggested,
“I may as well be away from here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He glanced at his watch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too late for the afternoon train,” he reflected.
“But there’s the mixed freight at nine-thirty. I
might ride over to the junction and get Billy Norton
to stop that for me. I’ll do that. Plenty of
time after supper. Yes: that is what I will do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He did not continue his walk, but sought the
little hotel and shut himself into his room, explaining
to the friendly proprietor that he was dead
tired, and wanted to make up lost sleep.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XII</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Sandy Larch had driven to Bonesta to meet
Mrs. Hallard, Unricht’s telephone message
having reached the Palo Verde in due season. The
cowboys were all out on the range. There was
no one about the corrals when Gard reached the
rancho. He had not expected that anyone would
be, but the place seemed curiously quiet and deserted.
A bunch of future polo ponies in one enclosure
were the only creatures in sight as he rode
on toward the casa. These nickered to his
own horse and the sound brought Wing Chang to
the door of his adobe kitchen. The Chinaman’s
face wrinkled in a genial smile as he recognized
Gard. The latter waved a hand to him and turned
toward the horse-rail; for he had caught sight of a
slender figure under the cottonwoods.</p>

<p class='c008'>She rose from the low chair in which she had
been sitting, reading, and awaited his coming, there
beneath the trees. She was dressed, as usual, in
white—a soft, clinging serge to-day, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>December afternoons were growing cool—and she
stood, serene and quiet, smiling welcome as he approached,
but the eyes veiled by her long lashes
were like stars. Gard’s heart cried out to her as he
took the slim little hand she held out to him in
greeting. He felt like a man reprieved. There
was no aversion in her look or manner. Westcott
could not yet have wholly blackened his good name
before her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you have come back to find everybody
gone,” Helen said, offering him the long chair he
remembered so well. “This seems to belong to
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He declined it—his errand was not one that invited
the soul to ease—and took, instead, a camp-stool
near the little garden table. Patsy, who had
been lying beneath it, came to greet the guest, with
wagging recognition.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s nobody gone that I came to see,” Gard
answered her remark with a directness that brought
the long lashes still further over those starry eyes.
Helen had seen him coming far on the desert; had
recognized him with a quick, exultant leap of the
heart, and had schooled herself to serenity, stilling
the tumult within long ere he stood before her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nevertheless, she was exquisitely aware of his
presence; aware too, that the secret fear of her
heart, lest memory might after all have played her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>false with reference to this man, was dispelled.
This was indeed the Gard of her musings. Her
veiled eyes took swift woman-cognizance of him;
of the strength and poise of his spare, supple
frame; the clean wholesomeness of his rugged
good looks.</p>

<p class='c008'>Almost before he spoke, however, she was conscious
that something vaguely portentous pulsed
beneath the quiet of his manner; something which
her own mood failed of grasping. He was stirred
to the depths by something not wholly of the present
moment. The joyous light of that first instant
of meeting had faded from his face, and a shadowy
trouble lurked deep within his eyes. She raised
her own to meet it with the steady, level glance he
remembered as peculiarly her own, seeking to answer
the need of his soul.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard’s courage was near to failing. It came
home to him with terrible force as he met her pure
glance, what a monstrous thing this was that he
had brought to lay before her sweet, untroubled
consciousness. He would have given his life to
keep sorrow from her; yet he was hungering this
moment to tell her his own.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he could not let her hear it from other lips
than his, and he believed that she must inevitably
hear the tale very soon. In a flash he saw, too,
that if she but believed him that belief would rob
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>the knowledge of its malignant power. The
friendliness of her eyes calmed the storm in his
spirit. In that instant he loved her supremely; but
for the moment she was more the friend to whose
soul he longed to lay bare his own, than the woman
he loved, whose faith he longed to feel assurance
of.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had no knowledge of the arts of circumlocution.
He drew from his pocket a folded paper
and began his story where, in his thought, he had
meant to end it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have brought you something to keep for me,”
he said, opening out the paper and handing it to
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked it over wonderingly. There was a
rough sketch of a mountain-range, with one peak
indicated by a little cross. At one side was a little
map, with directions and distances plainly set out,
and half a page of minute instructions as to routes
and trails. Gard’s training in the surveyor’s gang
had served him in good stead here.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it, precisely?” the girl asked; for complete
as it seemed, there was no word to indicate
just what it was intended to show.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what I want to tell you,” was his answer.
“It wasn’t best to put <em>too</em> much on the
paper. I got taught that the other day; but what
is set down there would guide you straight to my
gold-mine if ever you wanted to go.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>She flushed, slightly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why should I ever want to go?” she asked, on
the defensive against his eyes. “Don’t prospectors
generally consider it imprudent to show such
things as this?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Awfully imprudent. You must put it away
where it will be very safe, and keep it for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But why do you wish <em>me</em> to keep it? I think
you are rash.” Helen held the paper toward him,
but he put her hand back, pleadingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please keep it for me,” he urged; “I—I wish
it above all things. I am afraid—I expect to have
to go away for a time, to a place where <em>I</em> could not
keep it—for a long time, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where do you expect to go?” Helen strove to
keep out of her voice the dismay that was in her
heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There was a boy, once,” he said, apparently not
hearing her question. “He wasn’t a bad boy as
boys go, but you couldn’t have called him a good
boy, either. And he wasn’t smart, and he wasn’t
stupid.” Gard looked out across the desert, considering.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This boy went away from home the way boys
do. He thought it was slow on the farm back in
Iowa; and he drifted out to Arizona....”</p>

<p class='c008'>He paused. He found the story even harder to
tell than he had expected. Helen, watching him
intently, leaned toward him ever so slightly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>“I want to hear about the boy,” she said, softly,
and Gard went on, without looking at her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He got out to Arizona and went prospecting.
He found a claim, and had it jumped. He got
some dust together, and lost it. He lost a good
many things; his real name, for one thing, and
a lot of other things it does boys good to keep. He
was getting into bad ways; getting mighty worthless;
and then he got into trouble.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard’s face was pale under its tan, and a white
dint showed in either nostril. Helen was studying
the sketch of the mountains.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A man was killed—”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl gave a little gasp, and Gard turned to
her quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The boy didn’t do it,” he cried. “Before
Heaven! he hadn’t anything to do with it. Miss
Anderson—” He bent toward her, eagerly.
“Can’t you believe—no matter what comes up—won’t
you—oh, you must believe that the boy
hadn’t anything to do with it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her eyes were on his face, searching it as though
she would read his hidden thoughts.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can believe that,” she said at last, “if you say
it is true.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He drew a deep, tremulous breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me exactly what happened,” Helen urged,
and the way opened, he went on with the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>pitiful, sordid story, the girl listening, never
flinching, though her very lips grew white when
he told her what his sentence had been.</p>

<p class='c008'>He told her of his escape, but omitted mention
of his visit to Blue Gulch. He did not bring Westcott’s
name in at all, or dwell upon the treachery
he had met with. He told of finding Mrs. Hallard’s
deed; of his search for her, and of the
trouble he had found her in, and Helen’s heart
warmed toward him because of what he still did
not say; for she recognized Westcott’s share in this
matter. He came at last to the lost packet, and
the danger that he was in if anyone found it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think somebody has it,” he said, “and that
somebody will be getting after me. I am going to
try to move first; but may be I sha’ n’t be able to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think it was Mr. Westcott who found
those papers?” Helen asked, suddenly, and Gard
started.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did he say anything to you?” he demanded.
“What did he tell you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She drew herself up, proudly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am not in Mr. Westcott’s confidence,” she
said. “He has never spoken to me on the subject.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sandy and I, we <em>do</em> think that,” Gard admitted.
“He, Mr. Westcott, ain’t a friend of mine,” he
added, “and if he did find them I’m sure to hear
from him before long.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Helen pondered his words. She knew, in
various ways, that Westcott was not friendly to
this man. She began now to understand why,
and she realized that the attorney could be a
venomous foe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Any one of the others would have handed the
papers over to Sandy, would they not?” she asked,
and before Gard could reply turned to answer
Jacinta, who was calling anxiously from the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jacinta thinks it’s getting too cool out here,”
she explained, laughingly. “It troubles her if she
thinks I am running risks. Shall we go into the
house?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The afternoon was waning. Gard hesitated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must be getting back,” he said, following
her, “but I’d like to explain that diagram to you.
I want you to have it in case&#160;... if anything
should happen, I—want it to be yours. You get
your father to have some work done on it, and
file the claim right for you. My filing—isn’t
legal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The words came hard, and the color mounted to
his forehead. The girl’s hands were trembling.
Outside the sound of men’s voices came vaguely
on the afternoon stillness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it as late as that?” Helen asked, surprised.
“Are the men getting back?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Glancing out of the window they saw Wing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>Chang coming from the kitchen to the house.
Near the kitchen door a man on horseback was
waiting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mistlee Glad!” Chang’s yellow visage wore a
startled look as he appeared in the doorway of the
big living room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Man outside,” he said, addressing Gard.
“Four, fi’ men; holler; swear; say you come out.
Say you gotta come out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man by the kitchen door now rode forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hey, you, Misher Barker, Gard, whatever you
call yourself,” he yelled thickly, “come out ’n
that in th’ name o’ law o’ Arizona!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” Helen cried, “what does he want?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard turned to her with agony in his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s—what—we—thought—might happen, I
guess,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has—has someone come to take you? Don’t
go! Don’t let them take you! Oh, surely there is
some other way!” The girl’s voice was full of
horror. “Oh!” she moaned, “if only my father
were here! Or Sandy!” She looked at him with
eyes whose revelation almost broke the man
down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Be you comin’, in there?” the thick voice outside
sounded nearer. “They’sh plenty of ush to
take you,” it went on. “Y’ ain’t goin’ to hide in
there along o’ no girl, Misher murderer!—We’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>take you both ’f you don’t come out ’n be quick
’bout it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard caught the words and his face grew suddenly
stern. He opened the door and stepped
outside. The man on horseback swerved, at sight
of him, and galloped back a little distance to where
his fellows had come up. Gard could still distinguish
them all in the increasing dusk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come out here you damned murderer!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Broome’s voice, malignant and thick.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re goin’ git what ’s comin’ to you this
time,” he added, tauntingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no mistaking the menace of the
group; Gard realized, as he surveyed it, that this
was no posse, but a band of drunken cowboys ripe
for any mischief. At all hazards, he must keep
them from the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ride the murderer down!” someone roared,
drunkenly. But none of the men moved nearer to
attack the motionless figure on the door stone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard was thinking fast, and the burden of his
thought was the girl shivering on the other side of
the door. He must get these men away. She
must not know.</p>

<p class='c008'>Deliberately he stepped back into the room. As
the door closed behind him a bullet buried itself in
the upper panel with a savage “ping!” amid a
chorus of savage yells. Helen was at the window,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>ears and eyes strained to the scene without. She
came toward him, swiftly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must not go out there!” she cried. “Those
men are not officers; they mean harm!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her hand touched his arm lightly in terrified
appeal. The white womanliness of her upturned
face made his heart ache with tenderness. His
soul thrilled to a trembling sense of the sweet
possibilities of life. Then the instinct of the protector
awoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must go,” he said, speaking low and fast. “I
must go now; I must meet these men and—and
have it out with them. It is the only way. But
I’m coming back. Don’t you worry. I’m coming
back clear and clean—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t go!” she whispered in terror; for he was
moving toward a long French window that opened
toward the cottonwoods.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must!” His voice was tense with pain. Outside,
he knew, death lurked for him—just when
life had grown so precious! But more precious
still was this slim, white girl. For her sake he
must draw the evil crew away from the casa. She
must not know!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kick in the door! The patron’s away! The
coward’s hiding there with—yah!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A fleeing figure burst from the shelter of the
cottonwoods, Gard’s horse still stood at the rail,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>the bridle reins on the ground. The drunken
horsemen turned their own mounts and blundered
confusedly against one another as their quarry,
with a defiant shout that left them no doubt as to
his identity, threw himself upon his horse and
dashed away into the gloom. In an instant they
rallied from their confusion, and wheeling, were
after him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard made for the great rancho gate. He knew
the horse he bestrode; knew that it was not in the
mongrel brute’s poor power to carry him far, at
any speed; but at least he had a start, and was
leading his pursuers away from the Palo Verde.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Head ’im off there!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shoot him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Damn it! Don’t shoot! Catch the damned
sneaking dog an’ we’ll string ’im up!” It was
Broome’s voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>The words were borne to Wing Chang’s horrified
ears and he raised his own high, falsetto tones,
in a cry of warning to Gard. Helen, hovering
beside the door, heard also, and rushed out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Chang! Chang!” she called, gathering her
skirts as she made for the corrals; “come and help
me saddle Dickens!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She seized him by the arm and literally pushed
him before her. “Quick!” she cried. “You catch
the horse. I’ll get the saddle.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>She must get help. She meant to ride out and
meet the men who must soon be returning from
the range. She was coming from a shed, bearing
saddle and bridle, when Sandy Larch and Mrs.
Hallard drove through the great gate. Wing
Chang rushed toward them, shrieking.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Slandy! Slandy man!” he wailed, forgetful
of the discipline the foreman was wont to enforce
in the matter of his name. “You savee him!
Makee dlam hully up! Savee him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s eatin’ you?” Sandy roared, struggling
with his startled horses. “What’s the matter?
Talk straight you fool heathen! Save who?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mistlee Glad! They killee him! Go! Go!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wing Chang’s hands beat the air as though he
could thus impel the listener forward. Helen now
ran up and Mrs. Hallard caught her hand, leaning
forward eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it?” she cried, and the girl explained,
in quick, excited sentences.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We must get out there quick,” she said. She
turned with a glad cry: in their preoccupation they
had not heard the cowboys, who came galloping in
for supper, singing as they rode.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sandy Larch now comprehended the situation
sufficiently to act. He gave a few quick orders,
and in a moment half a dozen of the men had
faced about and were riding over the desert.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>“Round up anything you see,” the foreman
shouted after them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll be with you in a jerk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He meant to leave Helen and Mrs. Hallard at
the casa, but they refused to listen to such a
plan. Helen sprang into the buckboard, and as the
last horseman swept out at the gate the sweating
team was in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Four of the men rode out upon the plain. Two,
of whom Manuel was one, kept to the road, and
after these Sandy lashed his horses. He came up
with them a mile beyond the gate. Manuel was off
his bronco, studying some tracks that just here
turned abruptly from the way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They must have turned off here,” Sandy said,
springing out and straining his eyes to make out
the hoof-prints in the baffling gloom. “Gard’s got
a poor horse. They headed him off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” Helen cried, wringing her hands. “Why
didn’t he ride back to the rancho?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gard wouldn’t do that, with you alone there,”
answered Sandy. “But oh, Lord! Why didn’t
some of us turn up sooner?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sago Irish, who had ridden out upon the plain,
while Manuel studied the hoof-prints, now came
back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you pick up the trail?” the foreman demanded,
sharply.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>The cowboy shook his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sand’s too hard,” he said, sorrowfully, “an’
it’s gettin’ too dark.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sandy’s eyes searched the dusky landscape. He
was breathing hard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cannot we do <em>something</em>,” Helen pleaded, in a
voice of agony.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If they catch the señor—” Manuel spoke very
low, but the women’s straining ears caught the
words—“they will ride off where is the little west
fork. There they find—”</p>

<p class='c008'>A word from the foreman hushed his speech.
Sandy turned his horses and in an instant they
were flying in the direction Manuel had indicated.
For the first time Kate Hallard’s nerve was
shaken.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, my God!” she muttered, “Manuel meant
they’d find <em>trees</em>!”</p>

<p class='c008'>As she spoke a revolver shot rang out distantly,
upon the air, and with a wild yell the two cowboys
dashed off, leaving those in the buckboard to
follow.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIII</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>So this was to be the end!</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard, securely roped, stood with his back
against a cottonwood tree, looking at his captors.
There was no mistaking their condition, and they
left him in no doubt as to their intentions.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had not expected this. Re-arrest; re-imprisonment:
these had presented themselves to his
mind as possibilities; he had not looked to win
justice and reinstatement without a struggle, but
this—surely no sane mind could have foreseen it
as a possibility.</p>

<p class='c008'>The quick dusk of mid-December had fallen,
but one of the men was provided with a stock-lantern.
This had been lighted, and threw a
miserable glare upon the sodden faces of the men
who had him in their power. He glanced from
one to the other, finding ground for hope in none.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Broome who had captured him. The
cowboy had secured the loan of a fellow puncher’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>horse, standing at the rail before Jim Bracton’s
saloon. It was a good horse, more than a match
for the indifferent beast Gard rode. There had
been a mad race across the desert, a realizing sense
that the danger was real and imminent, and Gard
was in the act of drawing his revolver when the
rope that Broome flung settled over his shoulders,
and pinned his arms down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now you know how it feels, damn you!”
Broome said, when the crowd had their captive
bound and again in saddle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you don’t git no blindfold,” he sneered.
“You’re goin’ to see all that’s a’comin’ to you,
good ’n’ plain.” Broome’s face was thrust into
his, drunken, distorted, malignant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now my fine Mister Barker-Gard,” the thick
voice snarled, “it’s prayers fer your’n. You’ve
killed your last man, you sneakin’ coyote you.
You’ll swing in jest about two minutes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a growl of assent from two of the
others, and Gard recognized them as the same two
ruffians that were fleecing Papago Joe when he
had quietly but effectively stopped their game.
The fourth man was a stranger to him. It was
this one who carried the lantern, and he now held
it unsteadily on high, surveying the prisoner with
drunken gravity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell ye what,” he announced to Broome,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>“Thish ’ere thing’s gotter be done right. Thish
’a free ’n glorioush country. We don’t hang no
man ’thout ’n he gits a fair trial.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Trial be damned!” Broome roared. “Don’t
you go bein’ no fool Sam Hickey. This feller ’s
bin tried an’ found guilty long of a real judge ’n
jury, already.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hickey turned upon him with inebriate severity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you wa’n’t so dangnation drunk, Broome,”
he said, “I’d swat ye fer that remark. But y’
ain’t responsible now; that’s whatch y’ ain’t;
Thish ’ere thing’s gotter be done decent, I tell
you. We ain’t no murderers. We’sh populash o’
Arizona, seein’ justice done; an’ damn you, we’re
goin’ to see it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet we be!” interjected one of the others.
“An’ quick! This feller’s <em>had</em> his trial.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not s’ fast, Hank.” Hickey swung the lantern
perilously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’sh a judge, thash me; an’ there’sh
jury, thash gotter be you fellers. There—now.
Thash all fixed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Oh, God! Was it really to end in this tragic
farce? Gard pondered it with a sick heart. If it
was, why could he not have died in the storm, with
Arnold, two years ago?</p>

<p class='c008'>He realized the futility of any appeal to the
creatures before him. They were drunk; irresponsible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>as dogs at play, and they held his life in
their hands. His life: with all its new hope, and
love, and aspiration! Moreover, three of them
hated him. He owed even these few more moments
of breath to the maudlin vagary of the one
who did not know him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Prish’ner at the bar,” Hickey was mumbling,
“You are accusht o’ bein’ convicted o’ the murder
o’—Who ’n hell was it he murdered, Broome?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned to Broome with an effort at dignity
that nearly flung the lantern in the latter’s face.
Broome dodged it, with an oath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dan Lundy, you slitherin’ fool,” he snarled,
“Git ahead with your lingo, or we’ll swing you
when he’s done fer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hickey ignored the threat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, prish’ner at the bar, guilty er not
guilty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not guilty! I never touched Lundy,” Gard
said, earnestly. “I found him dead in his shack,
and they came in just as I was trying to lift him
up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Corsh: corsh: very proper to pleade ‘not
guilty’. Reg’ler thing—we’d a’ hung ye anyway
if yer hadn’t—fer’n example! As ’tish, we’ve gi’n
you fair tri’l. Be there anything you wanter say,
before thish court perceeds t’ ex’cute sentensh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard’s soul was in revolt.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>“Hickey,” he said, speaking very slowly and distinctly,
“This is murder you men are doing. You’ll
know it when you are sober.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As the lantern cast its light upon Hickey’s face
it seemed to Gard that he looked startled. He
realized, with a sick feeling of helplessness that
the fellow’s participation in this deed was due
solely to his condition. He even felt a sort of
pity for the man when to-morrow’s awakening
should bring the knowledge of what he had done.
If he could but reach the real man buried in the
addled brain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did not kill Dan Lundy,” he insisted, still
addressing Hickey; “You will know that some
day. Killing me to-night will not be the end of it.
Death ain’t such an awful thing that a man’s got
to be afraid of it, beyond a certain point. We’ve
all got to die some time; so it stands to reason it
can’t be such a bad thing as we think. But if I
do die to-night, you’ll be alive yet, to-morrow
morning, Hickey, and what do you think you’ll do
about it then?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hickey was staring at him, his jaw loosened,
the lantern hanging in a listless hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aw, shut up,” interrupted Broome. “You’ve
said all you got any call to say. We know there’s
bin a mistake made, n’ we’re goin’ to fix it up
right here. You savez?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Gard ignored him, still looking at Hickey.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Know Mrs. Hallard?” he asked, with the quiet
of desperation. Since by no endurable possibility
could he send a message where, alone, he longed
to, he must at least get one word to Kate Hallard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yesh;” was Hickey’s reply. “Know Missish
Hallard. Mighty fine lady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you tell Mrs. Hallard,” he cast about for
words that should guide Mrs. Hallard without enlightening
these ruffians. “Try to remember this,
please. Tell Mrs. Hallard that Sawyer’s all right.
Tell her not to give in to anybody. Anybody, I say.
Tell her not to be afraid. Will you remember?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hickey carried his lantern a little distance away
and set it down at the foot of a tree.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll tell ’er”; he said, gravely. “Hate ter hang
a frien’ o’ Missish Hallard,” he added, “just
plum hate ter do’t; but you see yourself how
’tish; law’s gotter take its course; so we gotter
hang you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where’s your rope?” one of the men now demanded,
and it was developed that the only rope
in the company was the horse-hair riata with
which Gard was bound.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take it off n’ hang ’im with that,” Hickey
ordered, and three men laid hold of their victim,
while Broome proceeded, savagely, to loosen his
bonds. A wild hope sprang up in Gard’s heart.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>It seemed as if Broome would never get done
fumbling with the rope, but at last it fell away
from his feet. His arms were already untied, but
three men held them.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a quick wrench he shook one free and
planted a blow in Broome’s face. The fellow
went down, heavily, and Gard fell upon the three
others, glorying that at least he could die fighting.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he did not mean to die. If he could but
get an instant’s start he could back his sober wits
against their drunken ones, in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hickey proved unequal to battle, and a single
thrust put him temporarily out of the fight. Then
Gard heard Broome’s voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shoot ’im! Shoot ’im, somebody!” he roared,
and Gard realized that one of the men he struggled
with had drawn a gun.</p>

<p class='c008'>He seized the hand that held the weapon, and
there was a three-cornered fight for its possession.</p>

<p class='c008'>Broome was on his feet, now, trying to find a
point of attack. Gard was doing more than fight
for the gun. He was gradually forcing activities
in the direction of the horses. If only he could
shake free for an instant, and make a run for it!
He meant to secure Broome’s mount. In a dash
for freedom he felt that the odds would be with
him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>Broome had by now got into the struggle again,
and hurled himself, from behind, upon the man he
hated. Gard felt the fellow’s great hands closing
about his throat, when suddenly, the revolver for
which he was fighting was discharged.</p>

<p class='c008'>Broome sank back with a yell and a moment
later, somewhere, far out on the plain, another
revolver cracked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Somebody’s coming!” the fellow called “Hank”
gasped out, wrenching free. “We’d better git!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The sense of approaching danger sobered him,
for the instant, and he sprang toward his horse.
The other fellow would have followed, but Gard
held him fast. He, too, realized that help was at
hand, and the realization renewed his strength. A
moment later, with wild yells, and a rush of swift
hoofs, two riders dashed up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hank threw himself into the saddle. Manuel
Gordo was quicker than he, however, and bore
him to the ground with one sweep of a heavy
arm, while Sago Irish, Manuel’s mate, dashed to
Gard’s assistance. His ready rope had already
secured the fellow called “Jim,” when the buckboard
appeared, Sandy lashing his broncos to a
mad run.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stars were out, lighting the sky with a brilliance
that shamed the lantern’s yellow glow, and
Gard’s heart leaped when he saw the lithe figure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>that sprang from the back-seat, as Sandy Larch
brought the horses to their haunches.</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman was already hurrying to his
friend, but he stopped short as Gard, never seeing
him, turned toward Helen. Mrs. Hallard, too,
had fallen behind, and the two stood face to face
in the bright starlight.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Helen!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was all that Gard could say, but his voice was
full of wonder, and joy. He never noticed that
he had called the girl by her first name.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor did she. For an instant she poised, bird-like,
her shining eyes seeking his. All thought of
their surroundings had fallen away from both;
there was for them, in that moment; only the holy
mystery of love, filling their souls. He held out
his arms and she came to him as naturally as a
child seeks its mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neither spoke. His face was against the bewildering
fragrance of her hair as her head lay
upon his breast. He held her close, in the safe,
sweet haven of his arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>He tried to raise her face, that he might see it,
but she kept it hidden, blessing the kind, wise stars,
that would not reveal her scarlet cheeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look up, darling! Oh, my love, let me see
your eyes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>For answer her arms stole up to his neck, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>she clung the closer against the strong, brave heart
that had borne so much.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did they hurt you?” she whispered. “Are you
all safe now? Oh, oh, my dear heart—what if
you had not been!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was trembling from head to foot. He
took her two hands in one of his, carrying them to
his lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am all right,” he said, “if I can only be sure
I am awake. But how <em>can</em> I believe you are here
if I do not see your face?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She raised it at last, turning it up to his gaze
under the pure starlight, and the sight held him in
a hush of wonder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You see it <em>is</em> I.” She forced a little smile to
her trembling lips, and looked at him, half afraid.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes,” he whispered, “it really is. And you
came to me. Don’t go away, will you? Don’t
ever, ever leave me!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIV</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Yelling wildly through the night, the other
Palo Verde riders came pounding over the
sand. Sandy Larch, who, with Mrs. Hallard, had
been investigating the extent of Broome’s injuries,
straightened up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where’s Westcott?” he shouted. “Any of
you seen the black hound? Wing Chang said he
had something to do with this business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Broome gave a sort of howl, whether of pain or
of protest, no one heeded, no one cared. The
new-comers crowded around the foreman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where is he?” They demanded, excitedly,
“Which way’d ’e go?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Search me,” was Sandy’s reply. “He must
a’ drifted before I come up. All I know is Wing
Chang said he was one o’ the devils after Gard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hickey, who had been taken with the others,
roused from his drunken slumber at the sound of
Westcott’s name.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He ain’t here,” he muttered, “Weshcott’s in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>Sylvania, takin’ care of ’s health. Thash where
he ish.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The cowboys were off before he had finished,
and as no one noticed him, he slumbered again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What will they do with him?” whispered
Helen. She had drawn away from Gard when
the others appeared, but he still held her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing, dear,” he replied. “They won’t find
him. He’s safe at Sylvania. I only wish you
were as far away from here as he is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She will be in a shake,” Sandy Larch called,
overhearing him. “An’ so’ll you be, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sandy had assured himself that bad whiskey
and rage were more responsible for Broome’s
groans than the bullet which had shattered his
collar-bone, and ploughed his shoulder. The fellow’s
howls and oaths had been silenced by a kick,
and no longer made night hideous.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sago,” Sandy said, turning to one of his cowboys,
“I reckon you ’n’ Manuel’s equal to the care
o’ these citizens. They kin all sit their horses, I
guess, an’ you two kin ride herd on ’em, into
Sylvania. I’d gather in their guns, if ’t was me
doin’ it, on’ leave ’em with fatty Harkins till
mornin’. I dare say they’ll be some peacabler
by then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman had already eased Broome’s shoulder,
crudely enough, by means of an arm-sling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>improvised from the riata that the fellow had
meant to use for Gard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll do till he gits to Sylvania,” he said,
with an indifference that was not feigned, “Mebby
there’ll be somebody there to tend to ’im.” And
he left the would-be lynchers to the tender mercies
of their captors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ashley Westcott was mounting his hired horse
in front of the hotel, when a stranger, on a hard-ridden,
pacing buckskin, stopped beside the rail.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, friend,” he drawled, catching sight of the
lawyer, “Your name happen to be Westcott?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that any of your business?” snapped the
owner of the name.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a bit,” was the calm reply, “an’ I don’t
care a damn. It only happened I was rounded-up,
awhile back, by a parcel of fellers ’t said they was
from the Palo Verde. They’d mistook me fer
you, an’ you sure have some enthusiastic friends.
They’re a whoopin’ it up yet, I guess, ’lowin’
they’re seekin’ your society.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who were they?” Westcott asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t exchange no cards with the gents,”
the stranger replied, grinning. “’Twas enough fer
me to know they was friends o’ yourn’. An’ seein’
you now, to realize your lovely disposition, I don’t
know ’s I wonder at the warmth o’ the feelin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>they showed fer you. They may be yer dearest
friends,” he went on, more seriously, “an’ you
may be goin’ to meet ’em this minute, but what I
sot out to say was, that if a party o’ <em>my</em> dearest
friends was lookin’ fer me in the tone o’ voice
them fellers was exhibitin’ I’d either stay where
I was, if I thought it was a good place, er I’d git
on my nag an’ I’d drift, mighty lively.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bah!” was Westcott’s reply, as he got into
the saddle. “I don’t know why anyone should be
hunting for me, and I’m not afraid of them if
they are. People generally know where to find
me if they have business with me.... Thank
you, though,” he muttered, recollecting himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re sure welcome,” the stranger said, turning
away, as the lawyer rode down the street.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re sure good an’ welcome,” he added,
to himself, “to all ’ts likely comin’ to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are a lot of things I’ve got to straighten
out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Gard, who spoke, from his place beside
Sandy Larch in the buckboard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think, too,” he added, addressing Sandy, a
note of sadness in his tone, “that I must tell you
good friends about them, right away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>No one spoke, but before he had time to wonder
at their silence Helen leaned forward and thrust
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>into his hands a big, official-looking envelop, which
Mrs. Hallard had given her, with a few whispered
words of explanation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s this?” Gard asked, peering at it in
the uncertain light.</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen laughed, happily and Sandy Larch gave
a low chuckle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s something that’ll interest you a lot,” said
he, “an’ I reckon it’ll keep; but good Lord, Gard!
Why ’n’t you ever let on?” Sandy’s voice was
full of loving reproach.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you’d only put me hip,” he continued, “a
word’d a’ fixed it. But I get the shivers yet,
thinkin’ o’ all might ’a’ happened.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t, Sandy,” pleaded Helen. She was still
trembling, with excitement and horror.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell him; quick!” she urged.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me what?” Gard was dizzy with weariness
and bewilderment. He held his big envelop
up, trying to make out what it was.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To think—” Sandy was still unable, for very
eagerness, to come to the point. “Who’d a
dreamt you never knew Jim Texas confessed, after
all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Confessed?” Gard’s voice thrilled with sudden
joy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“God! But it’s good to be a free man again!”
he said softly, and the low spoken words sent a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>thrill through his hearers. Years of suffering
seemed expressed in them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the others’ tongues were loosened, and
by the time the Palo Verde was reached, the story
had been pieced together, bit by bit.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Friends,” Gard said, as they walked together
from the corrals to the casa, “I don’t know what
to say; but I—I sure thank you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He bared his head, and looked up at the stars.
They were still there, swinging their ancient round
as they had done, night after night, above the
glade.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” he said, speaking to them as often and
often he had done before, when he watched their
solemn progress across the sky. “You knew. You
told me ’t would come out all right, and it has.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, as Jacinta appeared in the doorway, full
of anxiety about Helen, they went into the
house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll see you to-morrow morning,” Gard said
an hour later, to Helen, as they stood together
near the cottonwoods. Sandy had gone to the
corral for the horses; he meant to ride back to
Sylvania with his friend. Helen had persuaded
Mrs. Hallard to remain at the hacienda for the
night.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must see you just a little while,” Gard said,
“before I go away.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>“Go away?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen’s voice was full of surprise as she repeated
his words. “Where are you going?” she
asked; for he was smiling down at her as though
the thought of separation gave him pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mexico,” was the reply. “Sandy says your
father is down in Sonora.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, yes: but he will be home within a week.
He wouldn’t be away over Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know; but I can’t wait. I’ve got to see him.
I’ve got to ask him—” Gard’s voice sank to a
whisper, “I’ve got to ask him what he’s going to
give me for Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” the girl’s shyness held them both silent
for a moment, ere she found speech again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know what <em>I</em> want,” she presently said, edging
away from the other matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The word sounded like a guarantee that what
she wanted would be forthcoming.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jinny.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They both laughed, like children, at the idea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jinny’s yours,” Gard said, promptly: “but she
’nd I go together. We can’t be parted. I couldn’t
bear the separation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps—” He had to bend his head to
catch the low-spoken words—“Perhaps—Father’s
Christmas present will—will reconcile you.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>What his answer was is not of record. There
was but a moment to give to it; for a whistle from
Sandy presently warned Gard that his horse was
ready, and the two whispered their good-night,
in the friendly darkness.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XV</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Gard and Helen were married late in January.
Gard’s patience, and hard-won philosophy,
seemed wholly to desert him at the thought of
longer delay.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One would think,” Helen laughed, as he
pleaded with her to set an earlier day, “that you
were afraid I might vanish.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am,” answered Gard. “I always have been,
from the minute I saw you come around the corner
of the house that morning, with your tray and
grape-fruit, I’ve been expecting I’d wake up
some day and find that this part of the dream
isn’t true.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen’s cheek lingered against the hand which
he put out as if to reassure himself of her presence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is true,” she said, softly, “truer than the
other parts, the hard, cruel parts. <em>They</em> are the
things that have vanished, dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess you’re right,” was Gard’s reply.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>“They were the dream, and this is the waking-up;
the blessed waking-up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you know,” he suddenly said, “it was the
longest kind of a time—up in the mountain—before
I got over being afraid, just before I’d open
my eyes in the morning?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Afraid?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. That I might see—might <em>not</em> see—the
open.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, dear?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen spoke quietly, though it seemed to her as
if her suffocating heart beats must betray to him
what she was feeling. Gard had told her of his
escape from the cloudburst; all the incidents of his
Robinson Crusoe life, as she called it, of the coming
of the camel; of that wonderful journey to
the glade; of the glade itself; but this he had never
spoken of. She had thought of it as a door in his
heart yet closed against her. Now it was opening,
to admit her to his chamber of sorrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know what kept me alive through those
other years,” he continued. “Sometimes it seems
to me there wasn’t much there worth keeping
alive. There wasn’t much got away but a rack
of bones, held together by hate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen’s hands stole out and found both his as
he went on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought I’d got to get out,” he seemed as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>if thinking aloud, “I thought I’d got to get out
some day, just to kill Westcott. Then when I
did get away, I hadn’t anything left but the longing
to crawl off somewhere and die. I’m not
sorry about that now, though often, in the mountain,
I raged, to think I couldn’t have killed him
that night. Then I learned better. But I feel
mighty thankful now, that I never hurt him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You would never have hurt him,” Helen murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There were times when I would if I could
have got to him,” Gard replied, “but I got over
my hate. Somehow, that kind of thing can’t live
in big, clean places like that I drifted to. The
desert’s a hard place, my girl. It don’t look lovely
as this when you’re fighting for life in it. It’s
fierce as a tiger, but there ain’t any hate in it.
That’s only in men, but it’s deadlier than anything
the desert’s got.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s got to be desert, I guess. There
was a man in the surveyor’s gang I was with
once, years ago, always said that. He said you
take away the desert and some of the glorious
climates on this slope would all be gone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m talking a lot”; he interrupted himself
with half a laugh, “but just once, this thing’s got
to be looked at; because it was so black, and I
can’t let you think I wasn’t black with it. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>took that, I guess, along with the rest of it all,
to make me see things the way I do now; but I
ain’t asking pity for it. It was a desert place, sure
enough, but now it’s over. I guess I learned
some things worth while. Then when I got out
on the big desert, dear, I found God there, same’s
I’d believed when I was a boy, back on the prairie.
I shouldn’t wonder if He’d been there in the jail,
too. That’s the truth of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl leaned quickly, and gathered both his
hands to her lips, love, thankfulness, and pride in
his manhood, all struggling for expression. Stout
old Chaucer’s brave words came to her mind, and
she said them aloud, with lips yet trembling with
tenderness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And truth thee shall deliver, it is no drede.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That sounds like one of your old poets,” he
said, “and I guess he may have been in the desert
and learned. ‘There is no drede’,” he repeated,
thoughtfully. “I suppose he means no fear.
That’s right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was looking into Helen’s eyes, his two hands
closing over hers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is no fear,” he asserted. “There is
nothing <em>to</em> fear. Oh, girl—my girl! With hate
gone, and love come in, there’s nothing in the
wide world to fear!”</p>

<p class='c008'>February was well along when first they saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>the glade together. Morgan Anderson and Gard
had organized a company which, later, was to
exploit the mine. Gard had seen to it that Sandy
Larch had an interest, and Mrs. Hallard. Kate
Hallard had gone away from Sylvania, but her
matters were in good hands. She had sold her
business to Sing Fat, and gone to California.</p>

<p class='c008'>“For one thing,” she had said to Helen, when
the two had a long talk together. “I’m goin’ to
learn t’ talk decent. I can’t stand it. Sometimes
when I’m sittin’ still, not sayin’ a word, jes’ listenin’
to you, seems’s if the language I’m thinkin’
in is makin’ a noise, it is so howlin’ bad.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you think I don’t know; ner don’t you
b’lieve it don’t make no difference. It makes a
difference inside me. I’m sick of it. Sick of all
’t means to me. I never had a chance to find it out
before; but now I know, an’ I can’t bear it. I’m
goin’ t’ learn somethin’, an’ then, so long’s I
always want to work—you couldn’t make a lady
o’ the likes o’ me, not if you laid the money on
with a trowel,—I’m goin’ to work at something
worth while, an’ if I ain’t too old I’m goin’ to
learn to be a nurse. Anyhow, it’s good-by the
eatin’ house fer mine!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen and Gard went with the first outfit of
mining-supplies to the claim. These were taken
by wagon to the foot of the mountain, and thence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>up the trail, on the backs of the mules that had
pulled them. Gard had gone for Jinny, bringing
her by rail to Yuma, their point of departure, and
she and Helen had become friends forthwith. Together
they led the procession up the ancient wash;
for Helen insisted upon walking, and her saddle
horse and Gard’s followed in the rear.</p>

<p class='c008'>The glade lay in the pleasant afternoon sunshine
much as it had done the day that Gard said
good-by to it. A big live-oak branch had fallen
across the ocotilla bed where he had often rested.
Helen surveyed the rude structure with quivering
lips, as he pulled the branch away.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sandy Larch was unloading the animals, piling
up the stores, and getting things into shape, with
the help of the three men of the outfit. By the
big fireplace against the rock Wing Chang, who
had cast in his fortunes with the new company,
was taking stock of Gard’s culinary apparatus.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you think of it, Chang?” the latter
asked, as the cook investigated the upturned bean-pot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where you catchee him?” the Chinaman demanded,
much mystified.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I made it. Made them all.” Gard waved a
hand at the various fire-blackened clay pots.
Chang tapped the bean-kettle with an investigating
knuckle, testing its soundness.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>“Him no clacked,” he said, with a grunt.
“Mebby you no clacked; mebby so allee lightee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And no further expression of opinion could be
won from him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Helen made a swift round of the place, Gard
following, scarcely able to believe in his own happiness.
She inspected the cabin, and cast her vote
for living outside it. The seats and tables that
Gard had contrived gave her great delight, and
she rejoiced in the flaming green of the volunteer
crop of oats into which Jinny had already found
her wilful way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I dare say your gold-mine’s all right, Gard,”
Sandy said, coming up to survey the oat patch,
“but if it shouldn’t be, there’s another one right
on this here plain, if that water was turned acrost
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I vum!” He pulled a head of oats and examined
it. “The Palo Verde’s a howlin’ wilderness,”
he avowed, “to what a man could have
here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gard laughed as he led Jinny ignominiously out
of her green field.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No reason why you shouldn’t be that man,”
said he. “It’s government land, all ready to be
entered upon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If that’s a fact,” was Sandy’s reply, “an’ you
ain’t got no intentions on it, then Sandy Larch,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>cow-punch, is likely to blossom out as A. Larch,
rancherio. Can’t you see me a swellin’ señor?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wing Chang’s bright fire was lighting up the
trees and rocks when Helen, who had been bestowing
her belongings inside the cabin, came out
with something in her hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is this?” she demanded of Gard, still
hovering near.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took the big shell from her and stirred the
palo verde thorns about, his mind a surge of
emotions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are those for?” Helen asked, again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why,” he said, at last, “they’re my tally of
the days I lived in the glade.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at them, in the twilight, her face
touched with wonder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How many, many there seem to be,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There ought to be somewhere about seven
hundred, I suppose,” was Gard’s reply. “We
don’t need ’em any more. Let’s help along the
blaze with ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She caught his hands, with a little cry of dismay.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No! No!” cried she, “You must not destroy
them! Your record of days; hard, thorny days.”
She covered the thorns with one hand, in a passionate
gesture of protection.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>“They were good days,” he answered, trying to
comfort her. “I got a lot of good out of them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But oh, the price you paid!” Tears glistened
in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were in the shadow of a big live-oak, and
he drew her to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was sure a <em>man’s</em> price,” he said, looking
into her face. “But I got full value for it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The night was far spent when Gard awoke. A
late moon rode high in the heavens, flooding the
glade with white light. The familiarity of the
scene bewildered his rousing consciousness. The
circling trees, the murmur of water, the far-seeming
faint glow of embers in the great fireplace,
his narrow ocotilla bed with its bear-skin
covering: how well he knew them all! Had he
but slept and dreamed, to awaken after all to the
daily round of his accustomed solitude?</p>

<p class='c008'>He raised himself upon one elbow. On the cot
which they had brought for her, there, within
reach of his hand, Helen lay sleeping. A beam
of the white light sifted down through encircling
trees and fell across her face, round which the
night wind had fluttered her hair to soft disorder.
Her head was thrown back, her chin nestling in
one supporting palm. The pure, tender outline of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>brow and cheek thrilled him as he gazed, his soul
touched to awe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Long, long he looked, worship and wonder
stirring the deeps of his nature. It was no dream;
she was there beside him; there was no drede.</p>

<p class='c008'>He sank back upon his pillow, tears of supreme
happiness brimming his eyes, and yielded him
wholly to the quiet and peace of the large place.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
